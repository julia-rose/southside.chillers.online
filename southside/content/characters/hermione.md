Hermione Daydark was a late arrival to the Southside Chillers, but has become a valuable member of the crew. In [Chapter 17](/chapters/the-thaumazoologist/), the adventurers rescued her from an underground prison cell, where she was held captive by Khargol's shady entourage of Shargaas-worshipping orcs. 

She and Galadriel knew each other back in their community of Moon Elves. Hermione has never said so, but she knows more about Galadriel's family than she lets onâ€”in fact, she might be part of it...

Hermione is a leading scholar of magical creatures and the award-winning author of *Cursed Critters: A Practical Guide to Magical Pest Removal*.
