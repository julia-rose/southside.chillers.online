# Backstory

When first introduce, Harlan alluded to a background on the high seas, as a crewmember on a ship of cutthroats; he explained his divine magic as a development of "simple rituals to ward off harsh weather".

The, truth, however, was different...

Growing up deep in the wilderness, Harlan gained an affinity for nature at a young age. His parents, who had instilled in him a respect for the wrath of the natural world, passed away during a hurricane when he was a teen.

Harlan channeled his fury and sense of loss into clerical training under Kord’s auspices. This god, known to Harlan’s family his whole life, embodied the strength and resilience of nature that he wanted to emulate.

After completing his training, and gaining Kord’s favor, in his early twenties, Harlan was appointed guardian of the Cave of Storms. Hidden in a remote area, the Cave looked simple enough from the outside, but true mysteries lay within. Though it shared no ecosystem with the world above ground, save through a system of underground rivers and lakes, the Cave nevertheless maintained a roiling, furious thunderstorm wholly beneath the surface of the land. As Harlan discovered during his more than ten years of service at the Cave, the storm never abated, and even entering was an invitation for destruction.

Why a thunderous storm exists permanently below ground was beyond Harlan’s comprehension, but he knew he must protect it nonetheless. He spent these years mostly alone, foraging and studying what scholarly tomes he could convince those he met to part with. It was not uncommon for travelers to pass through the area, but Harlan ensured that they never lingered long. He would spin wild stories about the dangers of the forest, the monsters that lurk in the streams or the trees, anything but the truth of the Cave, the secret he was sworn to protect at all costs.

He may have spent his entire life as the Cave’s guardian, were it not for the strange dreams he began to receive. Always very vivid, these dreams place him in the sky, floating among the clouds. He wasn’t himself, but neither was he able to identify what form he had taken. He was simply among the clouds, peering down at images that resonated in his mind. An army marching through a now-barren field. A cult of fanatics setting fire to a forest. A band of goblins turning a stream into a sewer. Harlan assumed these cloud dreams were sent by Kord himself, and began making plans to take arms against those who would so callously defile the natural world.

One dream in particular called to Harlan as no other had. A band of travelers was converging on a far-away Elven city, ready to defend it from an unnamed evil. Harlan knew he must join this group, or put everything he believed in at risk. After consulting with the few members of his order he was able to reach, he located a new initiate able to keep watch on the Cave of Storms, and began his journey as soon as he was able.
