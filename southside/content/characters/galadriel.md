# Backstory 

Galadriel Torpleton Moonwater was born approximately 50 years ago to Ithiliel Moonwater, a Moon Elf, and Jeff “Bubba” Torpleton, a human of mysterious origin. Ithiliel died tragically in circumstances Galadriel doesn’t like to discuss, but which may be related to the secret society of justice fighters, the Harpers. Bubba Torpleton may not be aware he has a daughter--by all accounts, his love affair with Ithiliel was both misguided and brief. 

Galadriel was raised by her grandparents, Silmion and Luthien Moonwater. They are Moon Elf traditionalists, and were less than thrilled about their daughter’s union with a human. Regardless, they love Galadriel, even when they find her human characteristics difficult to understand. She can be impulsive and naive, frequently emotional--traits they attribute to her father. On the other hand, they say she has her mother’s knack for magic and intuition, and uses both to her advantage when it counts.

At 50, Galadriel is still fairly young for a half-elf. She spent her early life exclusively with the Moon Elves, and was begrudgingly respected for her skills as a bard. For the past decade, Galadriel has been traveling as a performer, seeking out fun wherever she goes. But if you were to ask her grandparents, they’d say she’s probably searching for her father. With his short human lifespan, she’s running out of time to meet him, if he’s still alive. All she has of his is a ring he gave to her mother.

Galadriel wants to be your friend and will trust you without much thought. She’s easily hurt if you don’t appreciate her musical gifts. She has a chip on her shoulder about her human side, having always felt inadequate in the Moon Elf community. She idolizes the idea of her mother and strives always to make her proud, though sometimes she doesn’t know what that means. She can be overconfident. She’s chaotic good, sometimes taking strange detours on the road to justice, but always striving to do right by others.

# Later Developments

In [Chapter 4](/chapters/porcine-comity/), much of Galadriel's personal journey is set in motion. She adopts a pig and names him Buddy, becoming his devoted protector and companion from then on. She also puts on a mysterious Gauntlet of Lolth (regurgitated by the pig), which grants her unusual spider-climbing abilities and a dark connection to the drow spider goddess...
