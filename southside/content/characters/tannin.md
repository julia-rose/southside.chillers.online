Tannin McBitters is tight-lipped about his origin story, but there's something there about a hellish disaster that devastated his clan. He has made vague references to his quest for revenge.

At the outset of his adventuring days with the Chillers, Tannin was a simple barbarian: flying into rages, reckless attacks, the usual. But he has grown since then into so much moreâ€”notably, a merman with the ability to command fish, breathe underwater, and speak Aquan. 

He provides comic relief along with his unusual skills and is beloved by his fellow adventurers.
