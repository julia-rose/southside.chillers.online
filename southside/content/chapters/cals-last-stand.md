[Cal](/characters/cal/) fails a death save, but his drake moves forward to attack [Kandir](/characters/kandir/) for 8 damage. 

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) uses his one fifth-level spell slot to cast Mass Cure Wounds on six creatures within a 30-ft radius. Everyone regains 18 HP, and Cal is revived. He then uses Spiritual Weapon (his giant book) to smack Kandir. But his aim is off, and he whiffs it.

Ape[-Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) makes two fist attacks against the two Amber Guard to Kandir’s left and right. She hits both of them, one for 31 and one for 28 dmg. One of them dies.

[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) uses his druid transformation power to turn into an ape himself and makes some fist attacks to Kandir. 

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) uses his trident to hit Kandir, hitting twice, for 28 damage. 

One of the Amber Guardsmen, who looks like he may be a druid (we call him Nature Boy Ric Flair/Flare), casts a spell. A storm consisting of 10 ft cubes of flame appears around Kandir. Those in melee range (everyone except Harlan) must make DEX saves. Tannin rolls a nat 20 and evades damage completely, as does [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). Cal and Chunk take 20 dmg, and Ape-Galadriel takes 40.

Hanamir slaps the dimensional shackles on Kandir (great speech) and tells him he is under arrest. As he does this, the gold box drops to the ground and opens just a bit. Inside, a small cube is visible. One side of the cube looks like granite, another side seems to emit light. 

To his henchmen, Kandir shouts, “get the cube and end this!” He also dismisses the shimmering bubble around him.

One Amber Guard casts Bigby’s Hand, a powerful mage hand. A big hand of shimmering force mirrors his own hand’s movements. It picks up the box and clenches it shut.

Another Amber Guard casts the same necrotic damage spell as before, but centered on Kandir himself. Everyone must make a CON save. Those who fail (Hanamir, Harlan) take 20 dmg, those who pass take 10. Kandir falls to the ground, as does Cal. 

The drake, in Cal’s stead, goes after the AG who cast Bigby’s Hand. The guard takes 15 fire damage, and his concentration is broken, making the shimmering hand dissipate. 

Harlan casts Aura of Vitality. A healing energy radiates 30ft around him. He uses his bonus action this turn to heal Cal.

Galadriel mirrors the actions of Bigby’s Hand and grabs the box, holding it over her giant ape head and running away with it. It’s difficult terrain, so she gets about 20 feet away.

Kandir is both prone and shackled now. He’s going to self-immolate! He speaks a word, and then bursts into flames!! He is turned into ashes!!! 

Chunk casts Call Lightning to hit two of the remaining Amber Guard (the druid and the necromancer); each of them take 38 damage.

Hanamir checks insight. He realizes that when Kandir said “grab the box and finish this,” this was an order the Amber Guardsmen knew about. This was part of their plan. The goons don’t seem perturbed by his death.Tannin attacks the necromancer. With Bless, he succeeds in attacking, and kills the necromancer with his trident. He whoops with joy.

The druid turns into a second giant ape. 

Hanamir uses his foot to kick his sword into his hand and moves to attack the second giant ape. He stuns it!  Then he makes a swirling kick attack. The drake uses his reaction to bless Hanamir’s kick with flame for an extra 6 dmg. It looks like something out of an anime.

The last remaining humanoid Amber Guard (the one who cast Bigby’s Hand) targets Cal, since his drake is in his face. He creates a bolt of lightning that hits Cal and then arcs out into 3 others: Galadriel, Hanamir, and Harlan. We each fail our DEX saves and take 52 damage. Cal is down again. Harlan is down too. Hanamir does a hands-free cartwheel and avoids the lightning. 

Cal rolls a nat 1 on his death save. The drake flies to Galadriel and takes the box. 

Galadriel then starts pounding on the other giant ape. She makes two fist attacks, one for 33 and one for 32 dmg. 

Chunk casts Healing Word on Harlan for 11 HP. He then retreats to avoid further attack.

Tannin pulls his trident from the fallen necromancer. He watches the giant ape battle and nods appreciatively. Then he nods toward the last Amber Guard and moves to attack with his trident. He hits twice for 29 dmg, and drops him.

Hanamir attacks the Amber Guard Giant Ape for 22 dmg, and it must make 3 DC 15 CON saves. It passes them all and is not stunned.

Cal makes his final death save… and fails. He uses his “last wind” to take out the Amber Guard Giant Ape. He shoots one last arrow that transforms into many arrows and skewers the ape. Before dying, he holds up a note and makes eye contact with Hanamir.

Galadriel send [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) to intercept the drake and bring back the box.

Hanamir takes Kandir’s ashes and the Dimensional Shackles.

We check for [Redyl](/characters/redyl/) in statuary, but he’s not there.

We prepare Cal’s body for a viking funeral. Hanamir reads the note Cal held up. It says: 

Friends,
Thank you for helping me find justice for my family. Finding you saved me, I only hope that I was able to do the same for you.
Cal

There’s a final line written in Orcish, which only Hanamir can read. “Keep them safe,” it says.

The next day, Hanamir uses the Mirror of the Past on the cube. In it, we see an early king of Aberith holding the cube, turning it in his hand, shaping the land that is now Aberith. He pushes back the sea and flattens mountains. He seems to pull stone out of the earth itself to build the castle that is now in ruins—this artifact clearly has some amount of elemental control. Then we see the cube stored away and kept in this box. It hadn’t been used for a long long time. 

Harlan checks arcana on it: it’s the Transmutation Cube. It’s the holiest artifact in the school of transmutation.
