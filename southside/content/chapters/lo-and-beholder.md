[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) disguises himself as Durzol and goes to Dolhen’s lair (a two-story building in the Kiln, half a mile away from [Odo](/characters/odo/)’s HQ) to await Odo’s wrath. 

Dolhen’s lair: upstairs are living quarters, downstairs is set up like a pub, but is really just a hangout for the orcs and half-orcs in this crew. 

We discuss how we want to proceed. [Cal](/characters/cal/) scouts the roof of the building to find another way in. There’s a window on the top floor that he can get through. 

Hanamir is inside as Durzol at the bar. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) has cast Disguise Self to become a gruff-looking female half-orc, and accompanies him. [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) is inside as a creature. 

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/), Cal, and [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) are outside, waiting for the go-signal. We’ve distributed sending stones to enable communication.

Those inside the bar are loitering. There are 4 other half-orc henchmen inside too. There is a loud sound from downstairs. Dolhen, who is there, orders all 6 of us to go check it out—this is pretty clearly the tunnels. Hanamir and Galdariel follow these orders and see that the hatch to the tunnels is being pounded on by someone trying to break through. Eventually, we see [Kandir](/characters/kandir/) come through the hatch.

“Dolhen! I need to see you! Right now!” says Kandir.

Dolhen comes into the storeroom, seeming confused. He recognizes Kandir, of course. 

“The jig is up. Odo’s gonna be here in minutes. He found out about our dealings. Quick! We’re going to need you to come into the tunnels. We can get you out of here.”

Kandir gestures to two kobolds he brought with him. 

Dolhen doesn’t know what to make of this, and looks at us for info. To disguised Hanamir, he says,

“What do you make of this?”

“It's a trap!” cries Hanamir. He pushes Dolhen down and darts toward the window.

The two kobolds crawl out of the hatch and flank Kandir protectively. Kandir pulls a long sword out of his belt and goes to attack Dolhen.

Galadriel (with Chunk on her shoulder) hangs back near Hanamir. 

There are a few rounds of fighting between the half-orcs and the suspected Kandir impostor. It is indeed a shapeshifter—it’s someone we’ve seen before in Odo’s hideout. A woman, Myn. She’s pretty effective at wounding Dolhen, which seems to have been her goal. The two kobolds were just enough support to hold off the other henchmen. Dolhen is basically dead, and his henchmen aren’t that enthusiastic about laying down their lives in this conflict if they don’t have to. 

So Dolhen is nearly dead on the ground. Myn has wrecked him with her blade. The half-orcs and the kobolds have become a cartoon scramble fight. 

“You can’t do this! Where’s the boss?” says Hanamir.

Myn turns toward him. “He didn’t feel like dirtying himself with this one,” she says, gesturing at Dolhen. “Who’s second in command here?”

“I suppose it’s me,” says Hanamir.

“Then I recommend you and the rest of your men stand down, since Odo has no issue with any of you.”

“Sounds good to me, but we are going to have to hear it from the man himself,” says Hanamir.

Myn turns to Galadriel.

“Does he speak for you?” she asks.

“Yeah," says Galadriel. "We wanna hear it from the big boss."

“I’d kill you all if I could,” says Myn. “But I have my orders. I’m supposed to leave this operation intact but get rid of Dolhen.” She pauses. “He’ll talk to you, but let me finish my work here. I’ll bring you back with me.”

At this point, Hanamir attacks her. Both his attempts hit, and he deals 15 damage.  Galadriel signals the crew with the sending stone ("THUNDERCATS ARE GO!") and casts Heat Metal on Myn's armor for 12 dmg. Myn also now has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until start of Galadriel's next turn.

Myn disengages and flees for the tunnels. Dolhen calls for aid from his henchmen, who go to help stabilize him. One of the henchmen is dead. The other two henchmen are standing around, not eager to pursue Myn. 

Chunk jumps off Galadriel’s shoulder and transforms back to himself. He casts Lightning, and she succeeds on the DEX save, but still takes half damage (18!).

Harlan comes in and attempts to cast Banishment on Myn. There’s a faint popping noise, and she disappears from this plane.  WOOOO!!!

Dolhen is now stabilized. 

“Easy, fellas, it’s the northern crew,” Hanamir says to the other half-orcs, in explanation for the firbolg and the human cleric. He rolls a nat 20! The half-orcs do not question this. They escort Dolhen upstairs. One of them seems trained in medicine and is tending to his wounds. 

“This is the day,” says Hanamir. “This is the day we make this crime org our own. The big boss is coming, and we can beat him.”

Tannin shows up in a huff. “Where's the fight? What are we doing?” (He missed the banishment.)

“I bought us some time," Harlan says. "I dunno what she is, but she’s not here now.”

A minute passes, and Myn doesn’t come back, so she’s assumed not to be native to this plane. 

Cal takes some time to investigate the tunnel entrance. 

"Maybe we can rig this to collapse after Odo enters," he says. Tannin helps and makes a stone cunning check. 

We set up some barricades.

Myn does have a sending stone, and it works across planes. She sends a message to Odo letting him know what has happened from her new location (the Shadowfell). Odo was furious. In a rage, he is on his way through the tunnels. Maybe 20 minutes later, the sound of tunnels crumbling from his eye rays comes from below. 

Harlan casts Bless on Hanamir, Cal, and Tannin. They now get an extra d4 to add to saving throws/attack rolls.  
Cal conjures a rhinoceros. 
Tannin plants the bear trap somewhere… in a dark place. Ineffectual. Has been tapping it with his toe, perfecting the spot, completely ineffective against hovering things tho. 
Hanamir is psyching up the other half-orcs and readies an action.
Galadriel readies a Cloud of Daggers centered on the hatch entrance for when Odo appears.
Chunk sticks next to Galadriel and prepares a Lightning bolt. 


Odo appears, enraged. Eyebeams flailing. Moving things with telekinesis, disintegrating things, etc. his anti-magic eye is open and is looking forward. The rhino charges toward him, but his eyebeam dispels it. He’s floating above the bear trap. He takes 14 dmg from the Cloud of Daggers, but then that is also dispelled.
He can’t see anyone yet. He uses his disintegration ray on a 10 ft cube of wall. There are a couple kobolds behind him, scurrying, staying behind him for now but are going to be his support crew. 


Harlan casts Spiritual Weapon and tries to bonk him in the head with it. It’s a spiritual BB gun. A melee spell attack with it. It does 6 dmg. 
Cal casts Zephyr Strike, which ups his movement speed to 70 ft. He runs around to the other side of Odo’s antimagic field. Makes two hits on him at close range. 20 points of damage from this. 

Tannin flies into a rage upon seeing the disintegrated wall. Pops out through the hole and stabs him with his trident. Is in the beam of hte antimagic field. Both his trident stabs hit. 

“It’s our time boys!!!” Hanamir says to the half orcs. He charges at Odo and makes his first hit for 12 dmg. Odo passes the CON save. He makes another hit for 4 dmg and Odo fails the CON save, and is STUNNED until Hanamir’s next turn!

There are 4 kobolds, and they are up next. (OH WAIT, there are only 3, beacuse one of them got snapped in half by Tannin’s bear trap!!!!)
The 3 kobolds try to attack Hanamir but none of them hit. 

Galadriel casts Crush Mind on Odo and while he passes his save, he still takes 14 dmg. Chunk’s Lightning bolt is loosed and hits Odo for (X) damage. 

Four more kobolds appear. 

Harlan misses an attack with the spiritual BB gun and also casts Sacred Flame, dealing 7 dmg.

Cal orders the drake to come around and attack the kobolds. He and the drake together do 34 points of damage to Odo. 

Tannin tries to signal to the kobolds that he should be their target. He points to the one who got snapped in half by the bear trap and says “I DID THAT!” But he rolls a nat 1 on that intimidation check. He growls and grumbles but the message does not get through; he looks more like a raving madman. He makes two more hits on Odo, for 20 total damage. 

Hanamir stuns Odo again, and does 24 damage. 

The kobolds attack Hanamir for 4 dmg. They also laugh at Tannin for 1 psychic damage.

Galadriel casts Dissonant Whispers for 6 dmg.

Chunk casts Lightning on Odo again for 26 dmg. ODO DROPS DEAD!!!!
