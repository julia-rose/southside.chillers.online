We return to battle, with [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) attacking the dragon. (??? sorry, I missed the deets on this one.)

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) fails a DEX save and gets damaged by the Guardian of Faith. He stabs the priestess for 8 dmg, then Shadowsteps away out of her range.

The priestess, still bound, Commands Hanamir and [Cal](/characters/cal/) to free her. Hanamir resists, but Cal fails his save and goes to remove the shackles from her wrists. She bestows another Lolthian blessing on the dragon.

The Fireboy uses his fireball attack against the priestess. Cal jumps nimbly out of the way with a nat 20, so he only takes quarter damage (7dmg) from the fireball as he’s standing pretty close to the priestess. The priestess takes half damage, 14.

The white dragon is up. It’s in pretty bad shape. It tries to attack the priestess’s shackles. It fails the DC 30 strength check needed to break the Dimensional Shackles.

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) throws his net at the dragon and it falls on the floor, ineffectually. He has no weapons, so he’s just attacking in vain. Imagine the most muscle-bound person you can imagine, on an ice rink, eating it continuously. He’s a wonder at the gym, but has no idea what he’s doing now.

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) uses her enchanted crossbow to target the priestess. She rolls a dirty 20 to hit, and then the crossbow is 1d8 + 2(enchanted) + 4(dex) so it does 14 dmg. She then uses the sending stone to send a mayday message to Ilvani, asking for backup.

The dragon flaps its wings and knocks Hanamir prone. He falls unconscious briefly, then pops back up with 1 HP. The dragon flies as far away from people as it can, onto a rock suspended in web near the top of the map.

Cal is still Commanded, and struggles to remove the Dimensional Shackles from the priestess. However, he fails the DC 30 strength check and is unable to do it. Cal is also near enough to the Guardian of Faith to be hit with 20 radiant damage. 

[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) casts Lightning on the dragon (again!), and it succeeds on its save, so it takes half damage. It’s still barely hanging on to life. It also looks no longer “fatigued” by its ice breath… looks like it’s recharged. Uh oh. 

Harlan casts Enhance Ability to give Tannin advantage on DEX/Acrobatics checks. He also casts Healing Word on Hanamir to bring him back to 12 HP.

Hanamir disappears. He reappears on the dragon’s back, and sinks his blade deep into the dragon’s neck, smiling to himself as he does so. (This does 13 dmg and is both badass and heroic.)

The priestess runs toward the central platform, giving Cal an attack of opportunity on her—he hits, doing 12 dmg. She tries casting Divine Word on the group of four clustered in the main platform. Tannin is deafened and blinded for 10 minutes. Harlan is deafened, blinded, and stunned. Galadriel drops unconscious. Chunk is unaffected. 

The priestess turns to Chunk and offers up her hands to him. “I would like to leave now,” she says. “You can make that happen, if you’ll remove these shackles.”

Fireboy now turns his fireball to the priestess. She passes her save, so takes half damage (12). She’s looking rough at this point.

The dragon makes a tail attack on Hanamir who is nearby. It does 11 damage, but not enough to drop him—he still has 1 HP left. It then flies to the central platform and does another cone of cold breath on the group. Everyone fails their save, taking 36 dmg—and for Galadriel, it’s a failed death save because she’s unconscious. Harlan falls unconscious.

With that, the dragon collapses. The wound from Hanamir’s blade was still wide open, so it did that attack with its last remaining breath and hit point. It comes crashing down and skids across the ice. 

Tannin passes his acrobatics check, finally! But he’s still blind and deaf. He’s still in a rage, though, so this isn’t really that different from usual. He runs Hanna-Barbera-style toward the point where he knew the priestess to be, and makes an unarmed strike against her. He misses her at first, but then flails blindly at her and hits for 8 dmg. 

Galadriel fails another death save. She’s up to 2! Yikes!

Cal makes a save against the Guardian of Faith’s continued presence near him. He chooses to fail (so that the Guardian will disappear), and falls unconscious.

The priestess looks terrified now that the dragon is dead. She repeats that she will leave if she is freed.

Chunk rummages through Galadriel’s things and feeds her a healing potion. She’s back to 6 HP. He then casts Lightning on the priestess. She succeeds on her DEX save, so takes half damage, 14.

Harlan succeeds on a death save—he’s stabilized.

As the dragon collapses into the ice and as the Lightning goes through the priestess, Hanamir springs from the dragon’s back and stabs at the priestess for 12 more dmg.

Fireboy (Knish?) is up. He feeds a healing potion to Harlan to stabilize him. Harlan is back to 7 HP.

Tannin makes an unarmed strike against the priestess, still blind and deaf. Flails a bunch but doesn’t hit. 

The priestess turns to Galadriel and starts making a case: she knows we’re here for the other dragon. Now that Lolth’s favorite pet has fallen, there’s really only one fate left for the one you call [Buddy](/characters/buddy/): to take the place of the dragon you jsut felled. She’d be willing to trade her own life for that of the dragon. But while doing this, she speaks the word “Free me” again, and it’s a Command—everyone in earshot needs to make a WIS save.
Galadriel, on her turn, fails her WIS save and then fails the STR check trying to remove the Dimensional Shackles. She receives a response from Ilvani, who says she can be there in two turns.

Chunk casts Healing Word on Cal to stabilize him from the brink of death. Cal is back to 5 HP. Chunk then throws his spear at the priestess, doing 10 dmg. 

Harlan casts Dispel Magic to try and prevent the Command from forcing Hanamir to unshackle the priestess. He succeeds! Hanamir is no longer Commanded. 

Hanamir feels the calming influence of [Istus](/characters/istus/). Grinning widely yet again, he strikes at the priestess. He’s going for non-lethal damage. He hits two strikes, doing 20 dmg. 

Galadriel responds to the priestess, seeming tempted by the offer to let her live in exchange for Buddy’s freedom. Galadriel says she’d have to stop attacking them—and the priestess points out she’s only been Commanding them to be freed the past couple turns. Galadriel says we’d need information, and she’d have to be willing to talk… the priestess says she could bring Buddy to us, right now, no information necessary.

The priestess summons another Guardian of Faith, a spectral spider. 

The Firekid prepares an action to cast Fireball on the priestess as soon as no allies are in range.

Tannin makes a DEX save against the Guardian. He passes, so only takes 10 radiant damage. He is at 5 HP. He makes a shove against the priestess. She’s knocked prone. And then Tannin grapples her. (He’s still blind and deaf!)

The priestess negotiates with Galadriel and Harlan. Harlan makes a 23 insight check, seeing real desperation in the priestess’s voice. He also makes a 26 arcana check, knowing that she can use the spell Gate to switch her place with Buddy’s. She will have to flee Lolth’s wrath for doing this. 

Galadriel nods, at this point, saying, “just do it.” 

Cal sprints forward to the group and casts a lion figurine. He says “SIMBA!” and a lion springs up. 

Hanamir goes to remove the Dimensional Shackles. Tannin is still tackling her and can’t see or hear, so this is awkward and weird. The priestess dismisses her Guardian.

Hanamir says “the dwarf can’t see or hear, so you’ll have to fix him if you want him to stop.”

When she’s freed, she removes the diamond from her necklace and makes a large circle in the air. We see a swirling portal appear. What appears to be a pocket dimension is visible throuhg it. They had stowed Buddy there. Buddy immediately bursts through it, excited to see you all! The priestess steps into the portal and closes the gate behind her. 

Buddy reunion!!!

We leave a healing potion for Ilvani. She is fine to stay put, wanting to kill Lolth, after all. As we leave (via the Quiznos), she says, “They had a god-killer all along!”

We recognize the syntactic similarity to the word “toys” in the Message scroll. God killer = toys?
