## The clown in blue-striped robes

We return to our heroes mid-conflict. Cal has successfully grappled the leader of the bombing group, a clown in blue-striped robes. He manages to whack the clown over the head with the butt of his rapier, while [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) tries to assist by applying the Dimensional Shackles. However, the clown squirms and struggles enough that wrangling any two limbs into the shackles proves impossible. Harlan instead uses Thaumaturgy to alert any bystanders that the temple is under attack. The sound of his booming voice causes them to scatter.

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) sees his friends struggling and makes a few quick moves. He first sprints toward the group of low-level clowns with bombs, faking a stab at one of them, before Shadowstepping sixty feet to join Harlan and Cal in attacking the clown leader. He hits with an immaculately-timed Stunning Strike, and the blue stripe clown is stunned. With this, blessedly, Harlan succeeds in placing the Dimensional Shackles on the clown’s ankles.

Meanwhile, [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) casts Spike Growth on the ground between that skirmish and the goons with bombs. The four clowns inside the spell’s area of effect are pierced by thorns, and are unable to move without incurring aditional injuries. The two outside of it take swings at Harlan. One of them hits successfully, dealing minor damage to the cleric. 

Now shackled and stunned, the clown leader receives grievous wounds from both Cal and Hanamir, who take turns just whaling away on him. They do a grand total of sixty-ish damage to him before he finally shakes himself out of his stunned state and realizes the gravity of his situation. He turns toward Hanamir with an open palm, revealing a flickering light that shortly erupts into a multi-branched bolt of lightning to hit Cal, Hanamir, Chunk, and Harlan. Only Cal manages to dodge the full blast—but all of them are struck. Harlan drops to the ground, unconscious.

Chunk steadies himself and moves so that he is parallel to the group of goons trapped in the Spike Growth. He then casts his own Lightning spell, which moves through them in a direct line, killing all four instantly. The bombs they carry drop to the field of thorns, fuses unlit.

The two surviving bombers now direct their attacks to Hanamir. One of them hits, and Hanamir drops, but quickly bounces back again, sort of like one of those punching bags that bounces back. (Cal swiftly turns on this individual and dispatches him to the great beyond.) Once back in action, Hanamir takes one of the recently-acquired healing potions and pours it into Harlan’s mouth, reviving him.

## ANOTHER DIMENSION! Another dimension! (after Beastie Boys)

The clown leader murmurs something—and with a faint popping noise, Hanamir, Cal, and Chunk disappear, leaving Harlan alone against the leader and the last surviving goon. The clown leader tries to escape on foot, despite being shackled at the ankles and thus looking very silly. Harlan gets an attack of opportunity and makes a solid hit to the fleeing fool with his maul.

Seeing this, the remaining goon tries to help his boss get the Dimensional Shackles off, but is totally incompetent at doing so—he’s just whacking his sword against the lock. Harlan takes the moment of respite to regain some health, and casts Healing Word on himself.

Meanwhile, Chunk, Hanamir, and Cal find themselves floating in a void. They’re not suffocating, or experiencing anything much, really. Cal takes the opportunity to cast Cure Wounds on Hanamir, who definitely needed it.

Hanamir gives his companions a significant look and slowly draws the quiznos from its concealed holster. He feels the warm, *toasty* presence of plane-shifting power enveloping him. Arms linked, the three of them travel through the demiplane back to the material plane, only a few feet from where they were.

## The clown gets away?

The clown leader is stunned by the return of the three he’d just banished to a pocket dimension. He casts Command and directs Harlan to remove the Dimensional Shackles—and unfortunately, Harlan is compelled to comply. 

The clown leader then teleports himself about sixty feet away and breaks into a run. But, thinking quickly, Chunk casts Thornwhip and lassos him, pulling him back. Cal, Harlan, and Hanamir fall upon him with their weapons in a great cartoon dust cloud.

The clown opens his palm again and grabs ahold of a doorknob attached to a door seemingly conjured out of thin air. He steps through the door and disappears, the door vanishing after him. 

Cal uses Primordial Awareness to sense that the clown is still within a mile away. Encouraged, Harlan casts Locate Creature, and detects that he is in fact within a *thousand feet* away. In fact, he’s in the direction of the temple itself—perhaps just on the other side of it.

## Evasive maneuvers

Many city blocks away from all this, [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) and [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) are engaged in their own clown conflict. After Galadriel’s surprise wand theft, she and Tannin flee as fast as they can down cramped alleyways, hoping against hope to lose the clowns trailing them. 

Tannin knocks over a barrel of water as he runs and then freezes it behind him, causing a comical clown pile-up as they slip on the ice. Rounding a corner, Galadriel casts Minor Illusion of a Tannin double going another direction. 

The two of them have successfully gained quite a lead on the clowns. They head back toward the Temple of Light and what they hope is a thwarted terrorist attack. Conveniently enough, they arrive just about at the point where the story left off with the rest of the crew.

## Chunk turns into a horse

Our heroes are determined not to let the clown in blue striped robes get away. Chunk shapeshifts into a war horse and Harlan hops onto his back. They gallop in the direction of the clown, who is apparently running on foot. Hanamir Shadowsteps ahead, still the quickest of the group, and sees the clown ahead of them. 

The clown realizes he’s being pursued and disappears into thin air once more. However, Harlan calls out to them all that he’s still right where he was, just invisible. Indeed, a fireball appears from the clown’s position and blazes through the sky to hit Harlan and Chunk. Chunk’s form returns to that of a firbolg, and he and Harlan are both rendered unconscious.

Hanamir Shadowsteps to the origin point of the fireball. He misses one swing before connecting with the clown in an unarmed strike. The clown loses his invisibility, having apparently maintained it through concentration. But before Hanamir can deal the final blow, the clown has one more trick up his sleeve: he makes Hanamir see a vision of his beloved Drephis State University in flames. Hanamir is frightened, and compelled to dash away.

It’s now or never. The clown, badly injured and stumbling, starts to flee again. But Cal uses his short bow to launch two arrows, and his aim is true. The clown drops, finally deceased. The spell he cast on Hanamir is broken, and Hanamir jogs back. Galadriel sees that the fight is over and stops to stabilize Harlan and Chunk before everyone trudges over to search the clown’s corpse.

The clown in blue striped robes, it turns out, was yet another fox man. Like Yurgoz, he was carrying some impossible-to-comprehend scrolls written in a language that doesn’t belong on this plane. He was holding a bomb, but no other weapons or interesting items. 

Hanamir uses the Mirror of the Past on this fox man. He sees him in Gehenna with five other fox men, including Yurgoz, and another creature who appears to be giving orders. This creature is humanoid, and kind of alien-looking—8 feet tall, with a long forehead and large eyes, and gray-green skin. He wears red and blue robes. This, Hanamir realizes, must be the true form of the clown known as Number Six!

The mirror also shows this fox man coming to the material plane and controlling a small group of humans’ minds. He carries out Six’s orders. 

We make copies of the scrolls and stuff the corpse into the Bag of Holding. We then check the Temple. All seems well; there were no explosions. We recover five bombs from the area. We search the other clown bodies, but everyone was packed light for this operation, it seems. They were all normal humans with mundane weapons.

## Denouement

Hanamir gives the head Cleric of Pelor the all-clear, and the cleric is very grateful. He hands him a small pendant of Pelor and says he hopes it will bring him good luck.

Back at the Prismatic Inn that night, Galadriel looks at the wand she stole. If only she’d been able to catch the incantation needed to activate it! It has some runes engraved onto it, but it’s nothing she can understand. She brings it to Harlan, who casts Identify on it. He learns that the wand can cast a spell called Programmed Illusion. It’s ten minutes of a looped illusion with a triggering condition, and it has three charges. 

We take a short rest for the remainder of the night. In the morning, Hanamir realizes that he understands another symbol on the Messenger’s scroll: the symbol with three slanted parallel lines means “planes.”
