}

**Session 83:** The Chillers go to [Deladriel](/characters/deladriel/)’s estate and find the entrance to the Demonweb pits.

**Session 84:** The Chillers venture into the Demonweb pits and encounter a Drow family, some pale spider-people (“Lolth’s mistakes”), and climb onto a giant wing, only to be attacked by some driders.

**Session 85:** The Chillers fight the driders. We’re introduced to [Harlan](/characters/harlan/)’s Spirit Guardians (“if Tinkerbell became a librarian”) and [Cal](/characters/cal/) sets a web on fire. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) refuses Lolth’s psychic invitation to give up the Quiznos in exchange for [Buddy](/characters/buddy/), and the crew takes a short rest.

**Session 86:** The Chillers make a deal with a Fire Giant and banish him back to the Elemental Plane of Fire. They then continue up to a tall spire where Lolth is said to reside. They meet a Shadar-kai Elf named Ilvani who has vowed to take down Lolth. She joins the Chillers on their quest. 

**Session 87:** Ilvani helps the Chillers fight a group of eight driders. Notably, Galadriel turns Cal into a T-Rex. After the driders are defeated, the group comes to the entrance of the Lolth tower.

**Session 88:** The Chillers explore the first floor of the tower and liberate Priscillo, a friend of Ilvani’s from the Shadowfell. The group gives her one of their paired sending stones to stay in touch—she stays with Priscillo to help him recover, and the rest move on. The Chillers also rescue an adolescent Fire Elemental Elf who informs them there’s a second dragon in the tower, one that does the Lolthians’ bidding.

**Session 89:** The Chillers fight a Drow priest and priestess, killing the priestess and questioning the priest. The group then moves on to another chamber, and several of them fall into a magical sleep. Galadriel dreams a familiar dream about [Magick](/characters/magick/) hurting Buddy. Harlan prays to [Istus](/characters/istus/), who imparts the knowledge that visions of something terrible happening to Buddy are things that have happened in the recent past, and that they must not cover their eyes.
