[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) picks the lock to the front door. There are several boxes with the same symbol that marks the front door. It’s dark inside, and only a little bit of evening light trickles in. He leaves the crates alone for now, and goes to check the back door. It does not seem to be locked. He puts an ear up to it and hears some muffled voices, seemingly coming from upstairs.

He opens the door. It leads to a small “break room” with snacks lying around. There’s also an open staircase. He can now hear the voices much more clearly. They’re still having the same conversation as before, about [Odo](/characters/odo/) and what to do now that he’s out of the picture. What will this mean for their ability to acquire certain goods? Still kind of vague, no specifics. They’re just speculating.

Hanamir withdraws and returns to the main room. He cracks open one of the boxes. There’s large plate armor inside, but it’s not made for a humanoid. It’s for some kind of quadruped. Maybe a horse? He opens a couple other boxes, and finds more of the same. In the fourth box he checks, he finds twenty precision-cut hexagonal red stones. They’re packaged carefully, as if it’s important to keep them intact. 

Hanamir hands [Cal](/characters/cal/) a flask of alchemist’s fire. He starts loading the red stones into the Bag of Holding. The other boxes don’t seem like they’re full of anything significant, mostly packing detritus. Hanamir raises an eyebrow at Cal, as if to say, “shall we start a fire?”

“Is there anything else we should try and find before that?” asks Cal. “Houseplants? Pets?”

While he’s thinking about pets, he notices some large paw prints on the dusty floor. Seems like something large has been walking around here fairly recently, and maybe wearing that armor…?

[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) suggests turning himself into a bear and stealing a set of this armor. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) makes an investigation check to see if she can find any business records on this floor. She does find a shipping manifest that mentions six crates of this armor. 

Cal shouts “There’ll be no more of your tomfoolery here!” and throws the alchemist’s fire down at the front door, setting it ablaze. The rest of us are out back readying an ambush, in case they exit that way.

Shortly, we start to hear a reaction from upstairs. One of the clowns comes downstairs to see what is happening and informs the others of the fire. We then hear one of them open some kind of large metal door upstairs. It sounds like a gate swinging open. It was not immediately visible through the window. Presumably, some of the others do use the teleportation circle. Only one of them comes down the stairs. He’s wearing white and pink robes, one we haven’t encountered before. He then runs out the back door and leaves it wide open. He’s now face to face with the crew out back and our prepared ambush.

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) has readied an action, and immediately attempts to grapple the clown. It’s a critical success! (29!) He’s completely subdued, no contest. Hanamir applies the Dimensional Shackles, and he is stuck.

Cal runs upstairs into the burning building to see what he can find in the large upper room. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) joins him, with plans to use his Ring of Featherfall to jump out the window if necessary.

Something else is coming down the stairs now. It’s a big pink anteater with a spiked tongue. Chunk uses his prepared action to make a bite and claw attack on it as a bear.  There’s another one coming down the stairs too.

Galadriel casts Cloud of Daggers on the creature that has come outside, doing 9 damage. Tannin lets go of the shackled clown and launches into an attack on the anteater. Tannin gets a critical hit on it with his trident and does 30 total damage. Then it’s the anteater’s turn. It tries to grapple Tannin, and it succeeds in doing so (with its tongue). It pulls him in close and does a lot of piercing damage. 

Harlan attempts to banish the creature, but the creature passes its CHA check. So Harlan runs back to the crew outside in the back. With his bonus action, he casts Spiritual Weapon to attack the creature that’s grappling Tannin. 

The creature on the stairs gets a turn. It grapples Cal with its tongue, pulling him up the stairs, and does 21 piercing with its tongue spikes. It then makes a claw attack for 9 additional slashing damage. 

Chunk makes some more claw and bite attacks on the anteater outside. He does 10 or so damage.

Hanamir rushes up to the anteater outside and makes some attacks on it. He succeeds in stunning the creature, so it drops Tannin. Hanamir is then able to make two more attacks. He does 25 total damage. 

Cal summons a giant constrictor snake and commands it to grapple the anteater on the stairs that is grappling him. It’s a grapple-pede. He then uses his bonus action to cast Zephyr Strike. 

Galadriel tries to shoot the anteater with her crossbow, but misses. She grants Cal bardic inspiration to help him with his anteater situation. 

Tannin, now freed from the grapple, attacks the anteater that had been grappling him. He does 32 damage and KILLS IT. After checking that the pink and white clown has not escaped (he’s just rolling on the ground), Tannin runs in to see if he can help with the situation on the staircase.

The fire is spreading a lot now, and the front quarter to third of the building is completely on fire. 

Harlan tries to cast Banish again on the staircase anteater. This time, it works! The anteater pops out of existence. Harlan, Cal, and Tannin now rush up the stairs and start grabbing papers that they see. Most of it is unburned. 

Cal gets a good look at the teleportation circle. It’s the most visually interesting thing in the room. It’s about to go up in flames. He jots down the symbols around the circle so that he could recognize them if needed. There aren’t many interesting items up here. There were two metallic cages that these anteater creatures were in. 

We take our captive, the documents, and the items from the bag of holding back to the Blue Crescent half-orc boxing club  monastery. He tries to bargain with us along the journey. 

“I am a man of some means,” he says. “I’ll give you a thousand gold if you’d be willing to let me go.” He introduces himself as Gundor Berrytree, son of Tum Berrytree. They’re a family of shipping magnates. 

Galadriel intimidates Gundor and says they’ll need info, not money, to keep this quiet from his dad.

Gundor’s brother was also involved with the AML, and got killed. Was an Amber Guardsman who had risen through the ranks.

Cal asks him what the biggest vulnerability of the AML. He’s not sure, but he thinks about it. 

“Maybe… the fact that we don’t know each other’s names. Or even which ones are Gehennans. They came for me and my brother because we were in advantageous positions. The reason we don’t know anyone’s names is because there are powerful people that are members. It’s a method of protection. So if you were able to identify powerful people… it would be bad for them.”

Tannin asks if there’s a ship in the harbor loaded up right now. They said it was one of the last shipments; everything must be out of Aberith by next week. The second to last shipment is going out in two days. They’re planning something, so everything needs to be out.
