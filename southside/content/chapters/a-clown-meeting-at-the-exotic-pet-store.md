[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) uses the Mirror of the Past on the Bugbear Songbook found in [Odo](/characters/odo/)’s possessions. It seems like Odo had direct dealings with someone that is very decorated—the leader of an orc armed force, apparently. The book in question was left over as part of a deal that was made. Odo purchased a large quantity of stolen books from this orc leader. 

[Cal](/characters/cal/) looks at the notes on Odo’s lieutenants. Fol, the leader of the goblin army, seems a person of interest. It’s a goblin/hobgoblin army of roughly 100 individuals. Seems to be a group Odo would send on a different type of mission than the others: outside of Aberith, generally, on recon and acquisition missions. Went to “go get things” from far away.

Neira and Canoba are now missing. After our encounter with them last time, there’s been no sign of them anywhere. Cal is concerned.

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) pats Cal on the back. “Don’t worry, we always have half a dozen to a dozen loose ends pursuing us. This is par for the course. There’s a Lich out there that’s waiting for us.”

“I’m used to being the pursuer, not the pursued,” says Cal.

We discuss what to do next. The main threat to us was from Odo’s people, not [Kaz](/characters/kaz/)’s, and we have achieved what Kaz had wanted us to do anyway. We can move much more freely around the Kiln now. How public do we want to be on the topic of us killing Odo?  And is Hanamir now known as the head of the Blue Crescent, aka the half orc boxing club monastery that now inherits the Odo HQ? Yes, Hanamir is now the leader of the Blue Crescent.

We decide to pick up on the AML thread. We do have one big lead, which is that we know some locations where they meet. They might remember us from our last attempt at infiltration. We’ve discovered another AML meeting place in the Kiln: 10 to 15 members meet here. There’s not a lot of overlap between this and the one that we infiltrated during the attempted bombing.

Step 1: find AML members at a known meeting place

Step 2: ???

We decide to turn [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) into a possum and give him one of the sending stones. The rest of us will keep the other and listen in on the next meeting. The ground floor of this place is an “exotic pet store,” otherwise known as Squawker’s place. He deals with animal parts and live animals too. You can get a drake egg or a manticore for the fighting ring.

Cal goes in the front door with a summoned drake and asks the person behind the counter how to train, feed, and care for this drake. 

Downstairs in the store room, Chunk gets into position before the next meeting. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) has given him Enhance Ability: Cat’s Grace (Possum’s Grace) so he has advantage on DEX checks. He rolls a 16 and is fairly stealthy getting into the meeting.

There’s only one person dressed as a clown in this meeting. This one is not one we’ve seen before, pink and blue. The clown is laying out how things are going to change based on recent setbacks. Seems like morale is low in the AML. 

“Don’t forget, after all, we still have the Sky Arrow,” the clown says. 

They’re openly discussing the fact that they don’t have everything that they need to carry out the plan. Some of the things they’ve hoped to achieve have been foiled. But it doesn’t mean that the core of the plan can’t take place, says the clown. They refer to Number Three and Number Six by name. “Three and Six are still eager to have us perform the duty we were chosen to perform.” 

The gist of this cell’s task: creating a large distraction so that Three and Six and other leaders can go forward with the plan to bring Aberith under AML control. 

“Once we have control of Aberith, the AML chapters in other cities can do the same. But they’re waiting on Aberith to fall. Don’t forget that. This is a key piece of what needs to happen here.” This particular group is going to provide some sort of chaos that will lead to the AML rising to power. 

The reaction among members is is fairly frustrated. Some of them are beginning to lose faith in AML leadership. Attendance seems pretty low, maybe lower than this group normally gets. ~7-8 people, rather than 15-16 as before. 

What type of chaos? “It will provide the means by which we retake Aberith.” What type of people are in here? Normal Kiln crew; a ragtag bunch, no obvious unifying characteristics. They all do probably work as thieves or other Kiln outlaws. But they’re here because they’re believers though, not because this is a side hustle. They’re not being paid, as far as we can tell.

As the meeting ends, people come upstairs through the exotic pet store. Cal scopes them all, including the pink and blue clown. Harlan casts Locate Object on the sending stone Chunk has so that we can keep track of where he’s going. Cal also sends his drake, aka Chuck Norris, into the skies to follow.

Chunk follows the pink and blue clown at a slight distance. He quickly exits the Kiln, so it’s clear that this isn’t his area of residence. He heads north, crossing the bridge to the fancier part of the city. He goes to the Port of Aberith and enters a nice building with a symbol carved into its door. It’s something we’ve seen before on the Message scroll—but we don’t know the meaning yet. It’s “square with external dots.” It’s a two story building, well-kept and clean. There are some windows on the second floor, but the first floor only has a door. Chunk arrives too late to sneak into the door after the clown. It seems like maybe it’s a building of offices among other businesses that have dealings at the port.

Harlan and [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) go to an office building two doors down (its lights are on) and knock. An old human man answers, and while he doesn’t know too much about the business two doors down, he’s at least familiar with the man who owns the building itself.

The owner of the building gave his name as Tum Berrytree. He normally wears yellow and white robes, and the old man describes them as looking extravagant and eccentric. These sound like clown robes. He assumes the symbol over the door is related to their shipping company—he’s often seen people moving things in and out of the building. But he’s not sure what business is really about, now that you mention it. 

“I myself am a spice exporter. Can I interest you in an Orb of Thyme?” says the old man.

Galadriel buys a full set of spice orbs for 100 gold. 

Cal, meanwhile, was casing the building the clown disappeared into. Nobody comes in or out during this time. There are at least three figures inside, judging by the silhouettes in the windows. It looks like they are wearing robes—more clowns, apparently. They are having conversations; nothing too alarming or sinister. There’s no obvious entrance that possum-Chunk could take, sadly. (The otter door is nailed shut.)

There are some tunnels to this part of town, Hanamir remembers. It’s possible that we could gain access to this building via the underground.

Galadriel casts Clairvoyance on the inside of the building. There are five distinct voices. One of them is doing most of the talking. Galadriel recognizes it as the black and white clown, aka Yurgoz the fox man from Gehenna!!! He’s giving a rundown of where things are at. He discusses five cells of the AML: the cell down in the Kiln, which we just visited, the cell that tried to do the bombings, the cell within the government, the cell in the shipyards, and the cell in the Flats (what’s left of them). They’re discussing low morale and drop off in attendance. He asks what the status is. They all report numbers being down by 1/3 or 50%, but still think they have enough to carry out the plan. 

“I’m going to have to tell Number Four and Number Six when things can happen. They’re both very eager to get things moving after the recent interference. They’re going to need to discuss what happened with Odo as well, because that’s going to throw a wrench into things.” They’re definitely starting to talk about us! “It’s unclear what their business is with Odo, but if they’ve taken control of a significant portion, we’re going to need to figure out what is to be done.” Number Six, he says, is particularly concerned about us. 

We stake out the building and wait for an opportunity to break in. Two clowns leave at one point, another arrives. They travel wearing their robes with the hoods up; we can’t make out any faces. Over the course of the night, the total number of clowns doesn’t drop down below 3 or 4. Yurgoz never comes out. A few more color combos we haven’t seen enter and exit. It’s pretty quiet. Either they’re staying inside, or they have a way in and out that’s not apparent from the outside. 

Hanamir and Cal decide to stealth tag team a break-in at 3 a.m. We use the Orb of Time to decide when it’s time. 

(square with external dots = freedom. We did already have this symbol, just not the one with the curve.)

Harlan gives the stealth group Possum’s Grace. Hanamir casts Pass Without Trace; Cal and Hanamir each have a 40 stealth (!). Hanamir uses his grappling hook to climb into an upper floor window. He peeks inside. The room has four clowns inside. He can also see a handful of boxes—one is open, and it contains clown robes. There’s also a teleportation circle. This is something that’s used somewhat frequently, so this IS a way to move between here and somewhere else. Hanamir jots down the sigils in the teleportation circle. He also takes note of the clown robe colors. 

He shimmies back down and indicates that the front door might be a safer entry point at this time, given all the clowns upstairs. Hanamir picks the lock and heads inside.
