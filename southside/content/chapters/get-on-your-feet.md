Those of us who were asleep wake up from the illusion, and we roll initiative.

A drow priestess, wearing gothest of goth outfits, is there. Full on Elvira spiderweb dress. Seems important. [Cal](/characters/cal/) has hit her with a poison arrow, so she has disadvantage on ability checks for an hour.

The first thing that becomes apparent: there’s an unmistakable sound of dragon wings. We see [BUDDY](/characters/buddy/). He flies toward the drow priestess. For a second, it looks like he’s gonna make quick work of this priestess—but he comes and lands at her side, and we notice that there’s a small (for him) crown on his head. 

She points in our direction, and we all must make CON saving throws. We are hit with a cone of slowing breath. All of us are hit except [Chunk](/characters/chunk/). We can’t use reactions, movement speed is halved, and can only use action or bonus action on our turns. This lasts for 6 rounds, or until we successfully make a CON save again.

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) casts Dispel Magic. The copper illusion fades, and the dragon is actually a white dragon! It’s the other one! It is not wearing a crown. Also, the thing that slowed us was not actually slow breath—the ground on the center platform is now ice. (The effect was psychosomatic.) We are in fact on difficult terrain, so our movement speed is still halved. We have to start our turns with an acrobatics check or we fall prone.

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) shadowsteps to the priestess and roundhouse kicks her. She is stunned, and loses her turn.

The dragon flies into the air and swoops really close to the group. It does a cone of cold breath and does 52 dmg to everyone except Hanamir, Cal, and Chunk (who passes his con save and takes 26). Harlan falls unconscious.

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) tries to move to Harlan to pass him a healing potion, but slips on the ice and is prone. He flies into a rage and, in a reckless attack, throws his trident at the dragon for 13 dmg.

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) feeds Harlan a healing potion, bringing him back to consciousness (and 7 HP). She also casts Shatter on the dragon, doing 5 dmg.

Cal casts Hunter’s Mark on the dragon and then shoots 2 poison arrows at it. They both hit, but the dragon passes its CON saves for the poison. It takes 20 dmg. Cal moves toward the drow priestess.

The dragon, in a reaction, beats its wings at those closest to it. Galadriel fails her DEX save and takes 12 dmg. She is knocked prone. The dragon then flies toward Cal.

Chunk casts Lightning on the dragon and does 25 dmg. He also tosses a Greater Healing potion to Galadriel, who takes it, and is now back to 17 HP.

Harlan casts Confusion on the dragon, which fails its save. It can no longer take reactions, and it must roll for a chaotic/confused action at the beginning of its turn.

Hanamir grabs the priestess’s wrists and dimensional shackles her. “Call off your goons!” he cries. She is now un-stunned, but bound. We see her disappointment clearly on her face. This definitely changes her plans.

First, the priestess bestows a Lolthian blessing on the dragon. The dragon almost winces when it receives this blessing, as if it took damage—which it did—but now the dragon has advantage. She Orders Hanamir using Geas (“gesh”) to kill the Ranger (Cal) who is coming toward her—but Hanamir passes his save. 

The dragon is still Confused, so can’t do anything, but does pass its WIS save, so is un-Confused for its next turn.

Tannin tosses his trident at the dragon again and does 10 dmg. His trident now lies far away—he goes to retrieve it, but he fails acrobatics and falls on his ass again.

Galadriel casts Shatter on the dragon again and does 7 dmg.

Cal runs up to the drow priestess with his rapiers and lands two slashes on her for 21 dmg. 

Chunk casts Lightning on the dragon again. It only takes half damage this time, 14 dmg. He then casts Magic Stone as a bonus action, imbuing rubble with magic, and tosses it to Tannin for him to use as a projectile.

Harlan casts Sacred Flame on the dragon for 6 dmg. 

Hanamir drives the priestess back with his blade, doing 15 dmg. 

The priestess shouts a divine word of Lolth, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Its range is 30 ft, so Hanamir and Cal are threatened. But they’re both fine. She then summons a Guardian of Faith, a giant spectral spider, and it hovers close to Hanamir.

The dragon now attacks Cal directly. It makes 3 attacks with bite and claw, but only one of them hits. 

Tannin throws Chunk’s magic stone at the dragon. He hits! But he fails an acrobatics check AGAIN and falls back on his ass.

Galadriel grants Bardic Inspiration to Cal. She then uses her enchanted crossbow to shoot the priestess, doing 7 dmg.

Cal casts Hunter’s Mark and makes all three of his attacks against the dragon. He deals 42 dmg. 

The dragon for the first time looks fairly rough. It takes a reaction to that last attack. It makes another wing attack and knocks Cal and Hanamir down.

Chunk casts Lightning on the dragon again and does 14 damage again. He also casts Healing Word on Hanamir, who is up to 30 HP.
