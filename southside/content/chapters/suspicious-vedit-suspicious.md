We let Gundor Berrytree go as long as he promises to hire someone from the Blue Crescent society to help out with loading the ships of magical items headed out of Aberith. 

We check out the documents. We get a pretty detailed inventory of what’s on the second-to-last shipment. It contains something called “stones.” Seems to be describing the red hexagonal items we found in the building. There are maybe 70 stones total, listed in sets of boxes, 12 or so per box. There are also “Caged passengers: 3.” (Not referring to the crew, clearly.) That is handwritten at the bottom of the shipping manifest. The other documents refer to prior shipments, mostly. There’s a destination written, but it’s not a place we’ve heard of: the Torgill Islands. A couple of the other sheets contain inventory that sounds more like weapons. Nothing particularly interesting, but occasionally there’s a box of armor, plate mail, some hammers, etc. 

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) shines the Mirror of the Past on the stolen red hexagonal stones. We see the stones laid out indoors in a deliberately-placed half-circle. Then they are picked up by a clown (in blue and black robes, Number Four) and placed into these crates. It seems as if these stones don’t have a very long past.

Our half-orc agent’s name is Gruumsh Junior. We get him a job as a stevedore? whatever that is.

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) goes to the library to talk to [Hermione](/characters/hermione/) and ask for her expertise on the strange creatures we fought last time. She’s gotten very into the arcane and otherworldly creatures since we last saw her. She recognizes the description as Canoloths, otherworldly defenders of secret knowledge and other valuable items. She’s not aware of where they’re from, but we know enough to piece together that these are from Gehenna. They are allies of the other Gehennans—but pretty low on the totem pole of creatures from that plane. They are typically tasked with defending valuable areas and are used particularly by Ultraloths. They’re usually encountered in pairs or groups to protect special areas. If we were to encounter more of them, she offers us some advice: they’re typically heavily armored, and have a strong resistance to non-magical attacks. They’re immune to acid and poison, and difficult to damage! It was a good strategy to teleport one of them away.  They can speak Abyssal and Infernal, and some exhibit short-range telepathy. You must avoid their tongues: they’ll use them to pull you in and bite you, as we learned. They have particularly high perception and are difficult to sneak past. They’re also quite strong. However, they’re not intelligent at all. They’re like malevolent Scooby Doos. 

Harlan then asks Hermione if anything else suspicious has happened recently. She says someone else, an elf, came in recently to ask about these creatures. They’re in New Iynesera, the rich elf neighborhood near the Flats. The explosion in the Flats did stretch a little into this area and killed about 40 elves. An elf came in reporting an attack by a similar creature somewhere in New Iynesera, was unfamiliar with it and was trying to get info on whether or not their friend who’d been attacked was in any additional danger after suffering a bite. The person did survive. 

Now, back to the ship. It’s being staffed largely by Berrytree’s company, but there are a couple of clowns (2-4) onboard as well. We try to get Berrytree to divert his detail to a free lunch at TGI Kordsdays so that we can be alone on the ship with the clowns. After the loading is done, his 8 people do go away for this lunch outing, leaving us with the clowns. [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) takes the opportunity to crawl into the ship via the anchor chain. Hanamir calligraphies a port authority inspection document, and asks for someone charismatic to bluff their way on. However, he rolls a 1, so it’s terrible. We decide to just Pass Without Trace onboard, because the forged document is so bad. [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) is a seagull. 

Our group stealth check passes, and we make our way onboard. Right as we come on, we’re almost seen by an Amber Guardsman (not wearing clown robes) strolling on the deck of the ship. We duck into a below deck area right at that moment. That brings us face-to-face with a lot of the cargo. We see the boxes, as we’d expect, and toward the back we see three metallic cages. Tannin quickly comes down below to join the rest of the crew.

We head for the cages to investigate. Two of the cages have Canoloths in them. The third has a sleeping human inside. Hanamir tries to pick the lock, but fails. [Cal](/characters/cal/) pours a vial of acid on the lock to disintegrate it, opening the cage. It’s an old human man, maybe 80 years old. We wake him up. He’s startled, and not sure who we are. He doesn’t scream, but he looks panicked. 

“I didn’t expect to be handed over. Are we there already?” 

“We aren’t, buddy, and you’re in a different situation now. How’d you end up in this cage?” says Harlan.

“Are you freeing me?” asks the wizard.

“It was on our minds,” says Harlan. 

“Those zealots, they captured me several months ago, and they’ve been making me do their dirty work for them. If you can unshackle me, I can be of great assistance to you.”

As we unshackle him, we get more details.

“I’m a wizard,” he says. “Those zealots had enslaved me, and forced me to do all sorts of preparation for magical spells.”

“My name is Profeus,” he tells us. “All of my belongings are around here somewhere. If we can get to them, I can teleport us off of the ship.”

We start opening boxes. One contains blue stones. He picks one up, inspecting it. 

“How unususal,” he says. 

At that point, we hear a somewhat familiar voice.

“Freeze right there.” It’s the voice of Jao Vedit, once leader of Amber Guard, now Aberith’s Minister of War. “Step away from the boxes, put down the stones.” 

We roll initiative. Vedit goes first as he got us by surprise. He casts Wall of Force to create a force field keeping us in the back of the cargo hold. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) tries to Dispel Magic on it, but it fails—the wall cannot be dispelled. 

Hanamir uses Shadowstep to get next to Vedit, then uses non-lethal attacks. Hanamir successfully stuns him. He then roundhouse kicks one of the other guys for 11 damage. The other guy is now also stunned. Now that Vedit is stunned, he drops concentration and the Wall of Force disappears. 

The third non-stunned bad guy does something and Hanamir must make a CON save, he passes it. He was attempting to turn Hanamir into stone! 

Tannin flies into a rage and launches himself at the un-stunned Amber Guardsman with a reckless attack. He rolls a nat 20 and just absolutely crushes this dude.

Cal goes after Vedit. He makes 3 attacks, all of which hit, for 24 damage.

Harlan casts Suggestion on the non-stunned guy. He suggests “Join us.”  It works!

The wizard is up, he searches a box to find his arcane focus. 

AG 1 is stunned, so skips his turn. AG 2 is now aligned with us, and it’s his turn—he grabs a sending stone and says “Everything’s under control, you guys hold back.” He tells us that there are 3 more AGs waiting right off the ship, but he’ll keep them away for now. 

Galadriel assists the wizard and opens another box. It’s full of red gems, but not his belongings.

Hanamir spends his turn Dimensional Shackling Jao Vedit’s hands behind his back. He’s un-stunned now.

Tannin does a reckless attack on the now un-stunned AG 1 for 14 damage. His second attack also hits for another 14 damage. This guy is now severely hurt.

Cal’s up. He uses some scrap fabric to gag Jao Vedit. 

It’s now Vedit’s turn. He’s pretty restricted, so he just turns and runs, presumably to go get reinforcements. This triggers an attack of opportunity for Cal and Hanamir, who are close by. Hanamir hits for 9 damage, and he is once again stunned. Cal also hits him for 9 damage. Tannin also hits for 15 damage. 

Harlan’s turn: he casts Command on the other AG 1. “Give.” He points at the sending stone. Hanamir pockets it. 

The Wizard searches again, still doesn’t find his stuff. 

AG 1 is really hurt and now has no sending stone. He makes an attempt to cast Flesh to Stone on Hanamir, but Hanamir passes his save. 

AG 2 is up and finds the wizard’s things. He tosses him the bag of wizarding materials—newt’s eyes, etc. 

We pause battle here and will resume in the next session.
