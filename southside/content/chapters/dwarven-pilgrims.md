## [Sanford](/characters/sanford/) & Son, Managing Attunements

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) takes [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/)’s hand-me-down Ring of Protection, now that he’s got the Cloak of the Bat. Fibsy purchases the Sphere of Annihilation and keeps it in his shack outside of Aberith. Hanamir also purchases the Portable Hole and the Stone of Mastery. 

Then Tannin gives the Ring of Protection to [Chunk](/characters/chunk/), and Chunk also inherits [Harlan](/characters/harlan/)’s Pearl of Power. Sanford and Son say they could sell us a second Ring of Protection for 3000 gold. Tannin tries to play it cool, but he’s jumping up and down. He purchases it.

## Leaving Aberith

This person is in Peloria, a town we have not been to. What we know: it’s a village the size of Eillin. It’s named after Pelor, one of the primary gods. The people there keep to themselves. It’s a religious hamlet of devout Pelor followers, predominantly Elves. Harlan makes plans to retrieve Zotz for the journey.

Before we leave Aberith, Tannin visits [Mirama](/characters/mirama/) in her office. He tries to say “I told you so” without saying “I told you so.” There’s a pen on her table, and he flips it around in his hands. “So. [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)! Huh. Who’d have guessed?” But it’s friendly, and mostly just a meeting to say goodbye, but also let her know that our hunches are okay, and if we need her help in the future, we’ve at least earned some credibility.

Our stature in Aberith has indeed risen substantially after the events with Kandir. King [Slee](/characters/slee/) now vouches for us very publicly. Mirama is embarrassed that this happened and is tasked with some additional responsibilities as they figure out how to rebuild the Council. She is grateful to us all. We all have a couple favors we can call in with her (or other powerful people in her circle) in the future. 

Hanamir shines the Mirror of the Past on Kandir’s ashes. We see mundane scenes of his life on the Council, hanging out with his cool bird… but there are a few things of interest. We see him handing out some clown robes. We catch a perfect glimpse of Kandir bowing at an unfamiliar sort of temple. This happens a few times—he seems to have been devout—but we can’t place the temple or what its object of devotion is. 

Hanamir rolls Perception. He notices that we never see Kandir’s childhood at all, only Kandir as we knew him. (He does use the crystal toilet quite a bit.) 

Looking around Fibsy’s hut, Tannin asks “So do you have a giant robot dwarf that can carry us to Peloria?”

“I suppose I could create something, but I think a cart would suffice,” says Fibsy. “I am not that kind of artificer.”

Just outside of Aberith, we stop at the Vasqin farm to talk to Chunk’s dad, Elris Vasqin II, and rent some horses for our journey. Tannin also mentions that he wants to ride Tannindor the Manticore someday. 

“For someone your size, I do reckon there might be a way,” says Elris. “I could work on a saddle and have it ready for y’all in a bit. The manticore’s not quite grown yet, but he’s growin’ fast.”

Tannin has a barbarian necklace with teeth and feathers in it. He takes it off and wraps it around Tannindor’s wrist. He hopes that his scent will sink in. He pats Tannindor on the back. “We’re gonna have some fun soon. Some real fun.”

## On the road

There are two paths available to us. One of them travels straight west. (See map.) 

“Now that path there is mighty dangerous. If you follow the other one up the river, you can cross the lake and it’s an easier way,” says Elris. It’s longer and has more difficult terrain, but it has people watching it, as opposed to the other one which is more likely for attack. 

Tannin whispers, “These horses are rentals, they’re meant to get dinged up.”

We head for the straight and dangerous path.

The first couple nights on the road pass without incident. During one of Tannin’s shifts on watch, he must roll Perception. It’s near the end of his shift and he’s a little tired. Something catches his attention though—maybe he can smell a torch of someone approaching. He perks up. There’s a small party of four fellow Dwarves approaching along the road. There’s nothing outwardly aggressive about the way they’re approaching; they just seem to be taking the same path and coming in our general direction. Tannin has spotted them before they notice him, however. They look like they’ll come upon the group in about a half hour. 

Tannin wakes the crew. Hanamir flies into a tree with his new Cloak of the Bat. Fibsy inserts a device into his bracelet and a mechanical snake slithers out from his cloak and wraps around his arm. Tannin and Fibsy head down to greet the party of dwarves.

“Hi there,” says one of the Dwarves. 

“Ach, what news from the west?” says Tannin in Dwarvish. 

“Pilgrimage we’re on,” says the dwarf. “Happy to meet you all.” He looks around nervously. “Just you two out here, then?”

“No, we’ve got some friends about,” says Tannin. He points to Fibsy. “This one promises to make me a robot!”

Since this is in Dwarvish, Fibsy just waves at them. 

“Oh,” says the dwarf, who introduces himself as Heggeck. It seems like they might not know what the word “robot” means. “Would you all care to donate to our pilgrimage?”

“Well, you have to understand, I’m coming from the east, and we don’t do pilgrimages all that much,” says Tannin. “But if you’re looking for a meal and a warm place to rest, you can head up to our campsite.”

“Kind strangers,” says Heggeck. “We would appreciate a bit of a meal.” He confers with the others. They seem very eager to partake.

“Let’s talk about the road,” says Tannin, leading them up to the campsite. “What’s been rough out there?”
“The town we just came through did not give a warm greeting,” says Heggeck. The town they were most recently in was Peloria. While there, they were essentially kicked out for attempting to proselytize. This pilgrimage they’re on is toward a “wondrous city” with many in it who welcome people like them. 

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) pours them some Aberith Ale. “That sounds very rude,” she says. “If you’re headed this way, there is a great city called Aberith. Is that your destination?”

The dwarves confer. They know it as Ken’te.

“If I may be so bold as to inquire, to what god do you bear witness?” says Fibsy.

The dwarves are skittish. They clam up. Galadriel rummages in the Bag of Holding until she finds the Message scroll, and holds it up. “Might you be familiar with The Message?”

“Oh!” says Heggeck. “The Message has indeed spread far and wide.” 

Chunk reaches into the Bag of Holding and hands them four gold pieces. “For your pilgrimage, no strings attached. Long journeys can be tough.”

The ones that have been quieter to this point open up and are very appreciative. They talk about trying to preach in Peloria, and how they were nearly killed. They only escaped because of a sympathetic Pelorian who freed them from prison at night. 

Galadriel asks them if they know the Messenger. The Dwarves’ Common isn’t so good, and they seem to not be sure about the word she used. 

“The one that crafted the Message? It is an ancient text. The one who crafted it is no longer around.”

“Where are you from?” asks Tannin.

They are from a small Dwarvish outpost in the woods not far from Peloria. “We found that there’s a calling among those of us who believe in the Message to seek out others and convey the ultimate truth of what the Message teaches. What it teaches is that we must all find our own community, for the gods have abandoned us.” 

Galadriel then shows them the brass key from Kandir’s house, the one with an unfamiliar symbol. The quietest dwarf looks it over carefully. “This symbol is certainly of the same language of the Message,” he says. “But it matches no text from the Messenger that I’ve ever studied.” He seems to be the religious scholar of the group, their cleric of sorts. 

“What other Messenger texts are there?”

“Ah, you carry the Message, but there is so much more of that time that our people have uncovered,” says the cleric. He pats a small stack of leather-bound papers he has with him. “We’ve spent quite some time studying this and trying to understand the lessons of that time, when the children played.” 

Hanamir skulks around in the background, still hidden, but very interested in these tomes.

“Can I take a look?” says Tannin.

“I can see no harm in it, but be careful,” says the cleric. 

The texts are in the old language, but have been annotated in Dwarvish. Tannin looks at the annotations. This tells of a story of a battle between the “children,” when they waged war upon each other. 

“You mentioned a sympathizer in Peloria who assisted you,” says Fibsy. “Since we are headed that way, would you mind sharing their name? We would seek refuge with them as well.”

“Didn’t get a name,” says Heggeck. “Was a woman out on a walk. Came by the jail, looked until the coast was clear. We thought she was going to try to harm us as others in town seemed quite upset with what we had to share. But she sprung the lock. Not sure how she did it. Barely saw her. An Elvish woman.”

They seem ready to crash. Tannin looks at the Orb of Time and says, “Well, seems like it’s time to hit the hay. It is night time.”

Hanamir has been eyeing the cleric’s bag of lore. He rolls stealth and gets a 29 (lol). He tries to copy down as much of the text as possible, including both the symbols and Dwarvish annotations. He then must make a Calligraphy check. He gets an 11 (not too bad). The Dwarvish he writes down no problem—but the symbols maybe aren’t great. Recognizing that his copying is not perfect, Hanamir puts his copy in the bag and steals the original! He switches out as many documents as he can in two hours. 

The rest of the evening passes uneventfully.
