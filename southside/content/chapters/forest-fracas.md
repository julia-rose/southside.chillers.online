*THWOMP!*

“Whoa—”

*CRACK!*

“Ow!”

*THUD.*

“Well, jeez! I was only trying to help!”

[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) shields his face from the wood woads’ clubs. They leer at him from beneath craggy, knot-like brows, their mouths wide and mournful. The trees around them sway in apparent distress, swinging the assorted luggage to and fro in the dark canopy above.

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) appears like a mirage at Chunk’s side within the shade of a tall oak. With a swift hacking motion, his shortsword connects with the woad’s bark and becomes lodged there. 

“Tough exterior,” Hanamir warns the others. While he struggles to pry his blade free, the woad uses one of its branches to flick him backward with astonishing ease. 

There are four woads in total, and they shamble westward ahead of the trees like shepherds of a slow, arboreal flock.

“All right,” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), striding forward to intercept them. He fiddles with a bead on a string around his neck. “See this? This is a Fireball.” He pops the bead off and brandishes it, and it glows red in the dim light. “We have no problem with you, tree boys, but my friend here says something’s wrong. You need to make it right, and tell us what’s up, or else this bead hits the ground.”

Two of the smaller woads shrink back a few shuffling paces. But the other two, including the apparent leader, stay put.

“I’m going to try and get a closer look at one of these bags,” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). She darts ahead, past the woads, toward the nearest tree bearing odd cargo.

“Be quick, if you can,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). He winces as he watches a woad clap Hanamir between two clubs with a disconcertingly meaty crunch.

Chunk closes his eyes and centers a spell on the four wood woads. With a pull of his hand, a patch of lethally sharp, wrist-thick thorns emerges from the forest floor. 

“Spike Growth,” he announces. “Everyone, watch your feet if you get close to them.”

“Nice,” says Harlan. From his perch on Zotz’s back, he casts Call Lightning on the closest woad, and a bolt of pure electricity illuminates the dark forest for a split second. The creature groans in its angry, percussive voice. 

A woad takes a successful swing of its club at Tannin. The one Harlan zapped steps through the patch of spikes toward one of the shambling trees, and disappears within its trunk—then reappearing fifteen feet away at the base of another tree.

“It has something like Shadowstep, but for trees!” cries Tannin. “Aw, dang, and it’s healing itself from the lightning! With vines and stuff!”

“We must work quickly, then,” says Hanamir. He Shadowsteps in pursuit of the tree and gives its still-exposed inner flesh a nasty slice with his shortsword, having eventually succeeded in prying it out of the first woad.

“Yeah,” says Tannin. His rage is still in check, but only barely. “All right, folks, take cover. I’m gonna light ‘em up.”

He chucks the Fireball bead to the ground between the two nearest woads. The explosion leaves searing impressions on everyone’s eyeballs as it shatters the comfortable darkness. The two woads screech and struggle to put out the flames engulfing their primary branches.

“All right!” says Tannin. He follows up with two swings of his trident, knocking some damaged branches off the woads’ trunks completely. “These guys are nearly toast. You see anything in those bags up there, Moonwater?”

“Not yet,” Galadriel calls down from a branch twenty feet above them. A woad swings a club at her and she just barely ducks out of the way. She spider climbs a few more feet, then grabs the handle of a swinging duffle bag. “All right, let’s see—” She rips it open, and there’s a confused silence. “There’s a flask, a dagger… some sandwiches…” She frowns. “It’s just... crap!”

The two crispy woads that took the Fireball damage both swing at Tannin and miss, their clubs hitting the ground pitifully. Chunk takes the opportunity to set one of them completely on fire using a still-smoldering branch. The woad crumbles to the ground, dead.

The other heavily-damaged woad uses its Treestepping ability to disengage from Tannin and Chunk. 

“Not so fast, my guy,” says Chunk. He conjures a thorny vine and whips it toward the woad, lassoing it where it reappears ten feet away. With a tug, the woad lurches back toward him, through the spike growth on the ground, and past Tannin (who hits it with his trident) and Harlan (who casts Call Lightning on it from the air). It dies.

“That was like a conveyor belt of pain!” says Tannin. “That was so cool, Chunk!”

Chunk beams. 

A yelp from the canopy above indicates that the least-damaged woad has found an effective angle of attack at Galadriel.

“Okay, turns out these jerks can climb!” she says. “I’m going to Bestow Curse on this one, and its attacks may prove to be less effective, or perhaps just less damaging—”

She sings a short, rhyming Elvish tune, and the woad that clings to the trunk of the tree she’s in whiffs its next swing at her. But it rallies, and its next attempt hits her directly in the face.

“Guess not!” she announces through a bright mouthful of blood.

Chunk thornwhips the third woad and pulls it flying through the brambles, where Hanamir and Tannin each take a swing at it. It crumbles into a pile of mulch.

“You guys are doing great!” Galadriel cheers while dodging another blow from the last, nearly untouched woad.

At this, the woad bludgeons her in the gut and sends her falling, unconscious, down to the forest floor. Her lute makes a fittingly discordant sound as it hits the ground.

“Stop!” says Chunk to the last woad. “Can’t you see you’re bested? Why won’t you tell us what’s wrong?”

The woad merely moans and lifts its club high, preparing to bring it down fatally on Galadriel’s skull. But Hanamir Shadowsteps to the tree and parries with one arm while striking with the other.

“Not so fast with that,” he murmurs. 

Tannin, Chunk, and Harlan each close in on the woad from different directions. Seeing this, the woad disappears into the treetrunk and reappears at another one some fifteen feet away.

Hanamir smirks. He Shadowsteps to that very tree and lands a satisfying blow to the woad’s back. 

“It’s looking a little rough now,” he reports to the party.

“Should I go stabilize Galadriel? Or try and help kill this thing?” Tannin asks the group at large. 

“Don’t worry, I got her,” says Chunk. He takes his medicine kit from his bag and jogs to her side.

“Let’s finish this sucker,” Harlan calls down from Zotz’s back. 

He swoops down over the woad and casts Sacred Flame—but somehow, it dodges out of the way. 

“Oh, come on!” Harlan cries. “That’s gotta be the most dextrous thing anyone’s ever seen a tree person do!”

“The luck of the wind,” says Chunk, helping Galadriel to her feet. 

Hanamir keeps Shadowstepping in and out of view.

“Trying to disorient it,” he explains, popping up just behind the woad. He stabs it in the back, really wedging his sword into its bark. “It can never be sure where I’ll appear next.”

The woad disappears into the closest tree and then reappears at a tree behind Hanamir. It claps him between its two clubs and then disappears again. 

“And two can play at that game, it seems,” says Hanamir wryly.

The party can hear its rustling movements a few dozen feet into the forest, out of view.

“It went that way!” Harlan calls down from the air. “Maybe a hundred feet. We could still catch it.”

“Oh, I’m completely over it,” says Galadriel groggily. “Let him go, for all I care.”

Hanamir nods and swings his bag from his shoulder, sifting through his inventory. 

“Aha,” he says. “Climbing tools. These should help us investigate those bags, what with the trees being in motion and all.”

“I can climb them!” says Galadriel indignantly. “I climbed one before!” Still woozy, she starts spiderclimbing up the trunk of a nearby birch. It shakes her to the ground, and she is knocked out once more.

“I got this again,” sighs Chunk.

Hanamir makes use of the climbing tools to scale the moving trees and drop the bags to the ground one by one. There are six of them in total. He opens one.

“Hmm,” he says. “Yet more ‘crap,’ as some of us might put it.” 

He unloads a dagger, a few personal trinkets, a child’s doll, and still more sandwiches.

“Hey, at least there’s some gold,” says Tannin. A few coins drop out from the bag he is shaking.

“So what was the point of this fight, then?” says Harlan. “Did we learn anything?”

“The trees are upset by something,” says Hanamir, “and the woads were leading them west. But the bags, and their contents, are a puzzle.”

Harlan casts Detect Magic. The trees themselves, being animated, glow with magic, but the contents of the bags remain the same.

“And at least we rid this plane of some of those abominations,” says Chunk. 

Hanamir unwraps one of the sandwiches and takes a bite.

“Not bad,” he says, through a mouthful. “It’s no Lolth tower meat, but it’s good.”

“You know...” Chunk says, perking up, “there’s a lot about this that doesn’t make sense, but the thing that makes the least sense is the idea that trees and wood woads would have a desire for humanoid food.”

“So where’d these bags come from?” asks Galadriel, awake again and glaring up at the still-slowly-moving trees. “Did they steal them from some innocent travelers?”

“Which, again, would be a highly unnatural thing for them to want to do...” continues Chunk.

“Maybe we should follow them and see where they go,” posits Hanamir. “They’re moving slowly enough that we can afford a short rest without risking being left behind, anyway.”

The adventurers spend the next hour and a half lounging around and, in Galadriel’s case, casting Healing Word on themselves. Harlan collects a few interesting-looking rocks and tosses them in the Bag of Holding.

“For projectiles!” he says.”You know, I can toss them down at enemies from Zotz’s back.”

“Are you planning on just riding your giant bat everywhere from now on?” says Galadriel.

“Kind of, yeah,” says Harlan. He tosses a rock in his hand and, instead of catching it, drops it at the foot of a tree. “Oh, hey, look at this tree. It’s got these thick gashes in its bark.”

“Looks like a few of them do,” says Tannin. “But that doesn’t look like the mark of a blade. More like…”

“Like a sickness,” says Chunk.
