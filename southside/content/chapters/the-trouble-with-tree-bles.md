[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) is ready, he thinks, for his first trip to Aberith to come to an end.

It’s not that he dislikes the city—no, the city’s fascinating, full of odd folk and pretty buildings, and there’s something about the way the sky looks when the sun is setting in between the dark rooftops that reminds him of holding a ripe peach in his hand.

But he misses the green and growing things, and that’s why he's a little too willing to take Squawker's word for it when the feathered ne'er-do-well directs him from the Kiln to a grove to the northwest of the city where he might "rrrrawwwwwwk—fashion an enchanted club! fashion an enchanted club!"

"I just want something that'll make me more helpful in battle," he explains, with a humble shrug. "If an enchanted club will do the trick, I'm all about it."

He wakes with the next dawn and tiptoes out of the Half-Full Flagon toward the western gate of the city.

When he arrives at the grove, though—or what ought to be the grove, based on the directions he was given—he finds something that makes his stomach lurch. 

The trees are all gone. There's nothing here but torn-up soil and webs of dry, dead roots. A bead of sweat trickles down the side of Chunk's face. Night and day, sky and sea, Obad-Hai and Beory—his understanding of the dualistic forces that shape the natural world tells him that something is broken here, in a way he doesn’t understand.

The adventurers have a few errands to run before they can truly begin their new quest. [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) decides to drop in on his fledgling monastery of half-orc youths.

The students, of course, greet him with a mixture of excitement and reverence.

“Mr. Hanamir!” one of the youngest (yet beefiest) gasps. “You still have the shortsword we got you!”

“Indeed, I do,” Hanamir smiles, patting it where it hangs at his side. “It was a thoughtful gift from a talented group of students.”

The student beams. Then the questions begin to fly at him, first murmured and then shouted:

“How long are you going to be in Aberith this time?”

“Can you teach us any new moves?”

“I heard the king sent you to a pyramid!”

“I heard the king sent you to a pyramid and you *died* there and a ghost stole your body!”

Hanamir laughs at that, and then winks at them.

“I guess you’ll never know,” he says. “And yes, of course I’ll teach you some new moves today. Got to keep your skills sharp.” 

The young half-orcs cheer. 

“But I’m afraid my visit today is spurred by the need to warn you about some dangerous things happening in the city, and a request that you look lively in the face of it,” Hanamir continues. 

The faces of his protegés grow deadly serious as he explains the situation with the clowns, the operatives of the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, and the Anti-Magic League.

“You should be aware that the Amber Guard is compromised,” he continues.

“Oh, we know,” says one student, and the others guffaw in depressing agreement.

“I mean in terms of involvement with the AML,” says Hanamir. “And keep an ear out for the doings of Ultas [Kandir](/characters/kandir/), from the king’s council. He’s wrapped up in this plot, but it’s not clear how, as of yet.”

He tosses a small bag of coins on the surface of a table. It lands heavily, and the students’ eyes widen.

“This is to help keep the torches lit until I return,” he says. “Now, who would like to learn a technique I call ‘Stunning Strike’?”

To Chunk’s dismay, no one else in the party seems as alarmed by his story of the imbalanced forest as he is. 

“So… hold on, is it good or bad that the trees can talk and move?” asks [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). “Like, is that part of nature, or is it an abomination?”

“It’s part of nature,” says Chunk, for the sixth time. “The abomination is that they had up and *left their grove*, which might mean something is *seriously out of balance*.”

“But okay,” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), “how do you know you didn’t just get the directions wrong? Like, you ended up in the wrong grove, so you didn’t see the trees you expected?”

“I’m *very* good with directions,” says Chunk, the closest he’s come to exasperation thus far. 

“I can tell this means a lot to you, Chunk, and I respect that. Not everyone understands my devotion to my library books, but that doesn’t make it any less sacred,” says Hanamir generously. “Tell you what. Why don’t a couple of us stop at the library and look up whatever we can about the three-sided coin. Maybe a few of us can also go and visit [Sanford](/characters/sanford/) and Son. And then we’ll go and check out this grove situation together on our way to the mountains.”

Chunk’s face relaxes somewhat.

“That’d be swell,” he says with a nod. “Something about it just didn’t feel right, and y’all have so much experience solvin’ problems, I’d just love for you to take a look-see.”

“Certainly,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). “Now, who would like to join Hanamir at the library?”

Tannin, Galadriel, and Chunk all pick points on the ground to stare at.

“I suppose I’m on my own,” says Hanamir, not sounding bothered in the slightest. 

The librarian greets him warmly and produces a tome on mountain civilizations that he thinks might contain a passage about an odd coin. 

“It’s been awhile since I’ve read it cover-to-cover, though,” admits the librarian apologetically. He hands Hanamir a large and dusty book titled *They Crave That Mineral: the Hill and Mountain Folk of Ivrend*.

Hanamir thanks him and sits down at his favorite table to read. It’s not long before he discovers an interesting passage in the section about an ancient dwarven kingdom long since disappeared from the mountains north of Aberith.

*Their delighte in the strangeste of mettals led the King to cast a single coyne from the rare substance & to keepe it on his personne at all tymes. It was said to possess untolde arcayne pouers & when turnèd it moved the King and his citty to a place of shaddowe or to a place of fey energie or to the familiare world of stone whence the kingdom originated. It was thus knowne as the COYNE OF THREE SIDES or in the speeche of the mountain dwarves the ELETAKUA.*

“That’s the one,” says Hanamir with a satisfied click of his tongue. He jots down some notes on a scrap of parchment and tucks it into his pocket.

The non-Hanamir members of the party encounter Sanford and Son just outside Aberith’s city limits. 

“If it isn’t the Southside Chillers, plus or minus a couple of heads,” says old Sanford. “I thought maybe you’d forgotten about me and my son here.”

His son waves but, in keeping with all their other visits to the duo of goblins, he says nothing.

“We lacked not the memory of you but the opportunity to visit,” says Harlan, holding his hand out to shake both the salesmen’s. “I trust you’ve kept yourselves well?”

“Always, Mr. Stormborne, always. So how can we help you today?”

“You know what I’ll ask first,” says Harlan. “Have you come into a Ring of Featherfall, by any chance?”

“Indeed, we have,” says Sanford. “I’ve been keeping my eyes open for one just for you, Mr. Stormborne. Cost us a pretty penny, though.”

“Oh?”

“We can give it to you for twenty-two hundred gold,” says Sanford.

“You’ve got a deal,” says Harlan, summoning it at once from the Bag of Holding. “What? I’ve wanted one of these ever since I got Zotz.”

“No one said anything,” says Galadriel. “All right, I’m looking to extend my versatility in physical combat. What kinds of things do you have?”

“We’ve got this cool enchanted whip,” says Sanford. “Perfect for a dextrous individual such as yourself. It’s just magical enough to give you a slight edge over someone with a regular whip.”

“All right, let’s do that,” she says. “I can already tell your other stuff is too heavy. What’s the range on this thing?”

Chunk peruses some hardcore-looking metallic clubs, but none are really speaking to him. 

“I gotta stick to my roots, you know?” he murmurs, touching the edge of one absentmindedly. “These are too industrial. I gotta have a melee weapon that really says ‘Chunk’.”

And finally, Tannin rummages through the Bag of Holding for some of the orbs from the Lolth tower that have been rolling around in there for months. 

“How about this?” he says, holding up the orb of Blibdoolpoolp for Sanford to inspect. “There’s a trapped soul in here. How much would you give me for this?”

Sanford’s mouth flattens into a skeptical line. He shifts a dial on his many-lensed glasses and peers at it.

“Trapped soul?” he says. “No trapped soul in here. What you got is a pretty marble, my friend.”

His son chuckles softly. 

“Oh,” says Tannin. “Huh. I wonder what happened to it.” He kicks the floor. “Well, do you still want to buy it?”

“Sure. I’ll give you twenty gold for it.”

“Deal!” says Tannin. “And I’m glad you said twenty, because that breaks us even. Zero money left, guys. All cleaned out.”

“Fine by me,” says Harlan, twisting the Ring of Featherfall in circles on his finger.

As Chunk leads the adventurers on the northwest road out of Aberith, [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) and Galadriel walk side by side behind the others.

*It is such a relief to have you back,* Galadriel thinks. *What did you do at the docks all this time?*

OH, YOU KNOW. NOT MUCH. I SMELLED SOME GOOD SMELLS. ATE TRASH. WATCHED THE BOATS COME AND GO. SOMETIMES A DRUNK DOCK WORKER WOULD SPOT A LITTLE PIG AND TRY TO HARASS IT, AND I’D LET THEM CHASE ME AROUND A CORNER AND THEN… YOU KNOW… THEY MIGHT WIND UP… CHANGED… FROM THE EXPERIENCE. MENTALLY.

Above them, Harlan is practicing Featherfalling off of Zotz’s back and directing him to swoop beneath and catch him. But at one point, he shouts down to the party that something strange is happening up ahead. 

“The trees up ahead are moving,” he says. “Chunk, are these the ones who left the grove, do you think?”

“I reckon they might be,” says Chunk. “Can you fly closer?”

Harlan does. He hovers close to one of the trees, which seems to sway in place as it inches forward. As he approaches, the tree whips one of its branches at him with surprising speed.

“Whoa!” says Harlan. He squints down at some satchels on the tree’s lower branches. A few of the trees have bags like this. “What do you all have there?”

He dodges from another branch swatting at him, and flies back toward the party.

“They’re mad as heck about something,” he reports. “And they have bags, like… actual luggage with them.”

“That’s…” starts Chunk.

“Let me guess,” says Tannin. “It’s unnatural?”

“Yes,” says Chunk. “I’ll go see if I can commune with them.”

He jogs ahead—his long legs making quick work of the distance—and sees the shambling trees, their branches indeed strewn with bags, such as might belong to an ordinary traveler.  Ahead of them, seeming to lead the way, are four wood woads, guardians of the forest. 

“Hello there,” Chunk calls out to them. 

There is no response. The woads continue ushering the trees forward. Chunk tries saying hello in all the other languages he knows, but none of them register with the creatures. He switches back to Common, hoping he can communicate his intentions, even if not in words.

“I’m a druid,” he tells them. “I mean you no harm. I want to help you if there’s something that’s caused you to flee your grove.”

The lead woad looks around and notices Chunk and the party, hanging back but within sight. It speaks, but no one understands—the sound is like a wooden flute.

Galadriel casts Comprehend Languages.

“It’s Sylvan!” she says. “He’s asking why we’re following them.”

“Because I don’t understand what’s wrong,” says Chunk. “Why did you leave the grove?”

The woad repeats his earlier words, but with more anger and urgency. 

“Where are those satchels from? Did you take them from travelers?”

The woad says something else, and it sounds like a snarl.

“He says to turn back,” Galadriel translates.

“Can we help you?” Chunk tries again.

But the woads have had enough, and they descend on him with clubs in their branch-like arms.
