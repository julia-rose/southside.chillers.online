“Ha!” cries [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/), with a triumphant punch to the air. The momentum of this gesture causes the pile-up of adventurers to topple to the stone floor.

“That was more closeness with all of you than I prefer,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). “But hey, looks like the door is going to stay open now.”

“Let’s put something there to prop it up, just in case,” says [Chunk](/characters/chunk/). He jogs over to the open door and, realizing there’s nothing tall enough except himself, stands awkwardly pressing up on the threshold. 

“No need for that, I think,” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). 

He shadowsteps through the door onto the lowest step of the staircase beyond. [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) scrambles to his feet and follows behind, seeming newly energized by this success.

“Yeah, let’s go, tall guy,” he says, giving Chunk a light shove on his way past him and through the door.

“Wait up!” Galadriel calls to them. “I’m nervous about those runes at the top of the stairs. Let’s use that trusty ten-foot pole, eh, Hanamir?”

They proceed up the staircase, prodding each step for hidden traps or weight-triggered plates, and when they come to the glowing runes on the top step without prompting another burst of flames, Galadriel frowns.

“I don’t get it,” she says. “What are these for, then?”

“Maybe they’re just lights,” says Harlan. “Which, as I’m sure you’re all aware, I appreciate.”

“All right, well…” Galadriel looks around nervously. “There’s another door up ahead. Let’s stay careful. Maybe we can toss something at it. Hanamir?”

“Yes, let’s try one of our thousand ball bearings, shall we?” he says. 

It’s unusual for him to have staunch allies in the caution-at-every-turn game, and his half-elf friend is surprising him today. He procures a ball bearing from the Bag of Holding and lobs it at the door ahead, which is a green-tinged, unmarked stone facade. The ball bearing makes a soft *tink!* noise as it hits the door, and it rolls away into some unseen crevice. Nothing else happens.

“All right, then,” says Chunk. “Now, maybe this door has something to do with nature, seeing how it’s green and all.”

He approaches it and runs a hand over its surface. 

“Nah,” he continues. “Just a door.”

“I’m going in,” says Tannin. “Oh, and here’s that ball bearing, Hanamir.”

He chucks the small sphere back to Hanamir, who returns it to the Bag of Holding with satisfaction, and then presses a shoulder against the door. With a creak of heavy hinges, it swings open, unlocked. 

“Are we done?” says Harlan. “Was that the weight of the world?”

“Not so heavy with teamwork,” says Hanamir.

“You did well,” says the ghostly dwarf king. “Congratulations.”

“Thanks, I guess,” says Tannin. “What now?”

“Now you may choose between the two remaining trials,” says the king.

“Truth of nature?” muses Hanamir. “Or meaning of loss?”

“Truth of nature, if I had to pick,” says Chunk.

“Yes, sounds less depressing,” says Harlan.

“What happens if we fail?” says Tannin.

“All of these trials carry the risk of death, and of failure,” says the king. “If you wish to turn back at any point, just say so, and you may.”

“Without ramifications?” asks Tannin.

“Yes,” says the king. “You have made no commitments yet.”

“This is chill as hell,” murmurs Galadriel.

“Beware,” says the king, raising his ceremonial hammer over his head once more. “In the Wild, you may find that you… *lose your chill*.”

The adventurers stand in an overgrown arena of uncertain height and a wide, circular base. Before them is a stream, splashing and rolling and bubbling in a way that seems unusual in terms of its physics. In fact, looking closer, it’s not clear to anyone whether the water is moving in any one direction, or if its chaos is due to the water’s inability to pick a flow and stick to it. There is a boulder, roughly twenty feet high, just beyond the banks of the stream, and two tall trees that stretch up indefinitely, branches grasping at something far away and out of reach. 

Like the mansion overrun with plant life, there is no mistaking this arena for anything but the Feywild. The sound of the stream is intercut with trills and croaks from unseen creatures in the dense foliage that coats every surface. There is a flowering plant near Harlan that seems to be shedding actual glitter in high-tempo puffs of respiration. He inches backward to avoid it.

“Look,” says Hanamir. 

Across the arena, emerging from behind the boulder, the adventurers see an androgynous figure glowing with opalescent light and holding a crossbow.

“Hello,” Tannin calls to it. “We’re here to face a challenge of some kind. Something about the ‘truth of nature.’”

The glowing person giggles and raises their crossbow. It’s not exactly a threatening motion, but it is definitely what someone would need to do in order to shoot someone else with a crossbow.

“You wish to understand nature?” calls the figure. Their voice seems to bounce in all directions like the bubbling stream.

“Yeah,” says Tannin. “Let’s go.”

“But why do you think you’ll succeed where others have failed?”

Tannin shrugs. He tugs at Chunk’s sleeve.

“I don’t know. This guy seems to know a lot about nature already. Look at him.”

Chunk touches one of the glitter flowers and smiles as several more blooms burst out from where his finger made contact with it. 

The glowing figure just giggles again.

“You are fools,” they say. Their expression, as yet unreadable from this distance, shifts to a manic, fanged smile that keeps expanding past the boundaries of a normal mouth. 

The adventurers each feel their stomachs plummet. The urge to flee is sudden and overwhelming. The giggle from across the arena is still soft, but its sound fills their ears with dread.

“You know nothing of the wild,” the voice continues. “And you will learn today.”

Galadriel finds it difficult to even look at the glowing figure, but with eyes covered, she still manages to cast Thunderclap across the stream. Taking this action steadies her. She takes a deep breath, and the terror passes.

Tannin shapes a small whip of water from the stream and hits the figure with it.

“Trying to see if it’s corporeal,” he explains. He, too, seems calmer after taking action. The water, strangely, seems to absorb directly into the person’s skin. “And… I’m still not sure?”

“Oh, children,” sighs the figure. “Thunderclap? Water Whip? Nature is vicious. I don’t think any of you have what it takes.”

The figure holds up a hand and points it at Harlan. A beam of milky light, like a spike made of pearl, shoots across the jungle and impales Harlan between the eyes. He stands motionless, frozen in place, though seemingly unharmed.

Chunk gasps. Hanamir, evidently fighting mortal terror, looks up at the figure and looses several darts at it. Each one misses.

“You will all meet your end here,” concludes the glimmering figure.

But Chunk seems to have broken free of his own fear out of horror at what happened to Harlan. He calls a lightning bolt out out of thin air and brings it down against this foe, taking them by surprise and knocking them to the ground. 

“All right,” they say. “Maybe this will be fun after all.”

“Yeah!” Galadriel shouts. “I’d say so! Because it’ll be fun for us to destroy you!” 

She casts Cloud of Daggers at the figure, but they Misty Step out of the way before the blades can find purchase. Tannin’s eyes dart around the arena.

“I’ll try and freeze the mist if they reappear in it—” he starts. 

But the figure has already reappeared, standing on top of the boulder near the center of the arena. They giggle again and cheekily brush their shoulders off. With this flourish, a molten ball of light swirls in their hand, until a beam of color shoots out from each of their fingers. 

“Look out!” says Galadriel. A beam of indigo light passes through her. She flinches, but nothing happens. “Indigo is not a real color, so that makes sense. Nice try.”

Tannin does a heroic dab as a beam of violet light hits him. His eyeballs, which he thinks might have otherwise been blinded, are shielded from the assault.

Chunk, however, is not so lucky. The green beam hits him in the stomach, causing him to double over with nausea. His blue complexion looks almost teal. The adventurers look away so as to give him some privacy during the loud and thorough vomiting that ensues.

“Hmph,” says the figure, when they realize that only one of their targets was negatively affected by the rainbow attack. 

Chunk stands and launches another lightning bolt at them. It hits, partially, and the figure takes more damage. Galadriel lands an arrow in their chest.

“All right, check this out,” says Tannin. “I’m going to do a dyno climb up there and just wail on ‘em. All these ranged attacks make me think that’s my best move.”

“Be careful!” says Galadriel. “And what’s a dyno climb?”

In explanation, Tannin takes a running leap up the side of the boulder, like a goat jumping from nook to nook, until he’s standing face-to-face with the fey figure. He then takes two savage swings of his trident that both rip potentially fatal holes in the figure’s torso. 

“AaAaAAAaGhghGHeghh!” they scream. Enraged, they hold out a hand to Tannin’s forehead and drop him unconscious. As with Harlan, he does not seem to be harmed beyond this—but Tannin now sleeps peacefully atop the boulder in the middle of the arena.

Hanamir, it seems, has finally broken free of the initial terror that had gripped him so strongly. He sprints across the arena and scales the boulder with impressive speed, takes a few odd, whiffing swings at the figure, and then lands one well-placed punch that stuns them.

“Nice one!” calls Galadriel. She takes the opportunity to let another arrow fly. The figure is hit, and at once breaks out of their stunned state and turns toward Galadriel. But instead of casting the next deadly beam of light at her, they cast it at the little pig standing at her feet.

“Hey! He’s not involved!” Galadriel snarls. In her head, she asks, *[Buddy](/characters/buddy/), are you all right?!*

I’M… OKAY. 

*What did they do to you?*

But there’s no response.

Hanamir seems to have achieved a second wind, and as the fey figure’s attention is focused on Buddy, he swoops in for another Stunning Strike. It’s difficult to tell—the figure still glows with a supernatural, lustrous light—but Hanamir believes this adversary is on the ropes. He takes the moment of respite to give Tannin a gentle nudge with his boot. 

“Dang, what a nap,” Tannin says, yawning and opening his eyes. “Are we winning?”

In answer, both Chunk and the fey figure rally brutal attacks against one another. Chunk sends his last bolt of lightning piercing from the unseen sky above. The fey figure conjures a moonbeam that centers itself on Chunk and suspends him in the air, causing him to writhe in apparent agony. After a moment or two, both Chunk and the foe fall to the ground in unconscious collapse.

But whereas Chunk lies motionless on the ground, the figure evaporates—first, their glow dims, and then their body fades from view. In the space where they lay, a door appears.

Harlan is released from whatever spell had held him paralyzed. 

“I saw the whole thing,” he says. “Let’s get Chunk stabilized first, but I can’t tell you how eager I am to not be stuck in here anymore.”

While Harlan helps Chunk, Hanamir opens a sack and starts stuffing leaves from the two tall trees inside it.

“What are those for?” asks Galadriel.

“Experiments,” says Hanamir, with a cryptic smile.
