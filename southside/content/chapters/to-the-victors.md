What to do with Dolhen? He assumes he’s a dead man because Myn was coming for him. Now that [Odo](/characters/odo/)’s dead and Myn has disappeared, people will assume he’s responsible. He’s eager for protection. [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) addresses him.

"Sir, there’s been a change of command," Hanamir says. "Odo is dead. There’s a new organization taking its place. I’ll tell you right now, it won’t be as profitable, but you have two choices: you can work with us and be a part of it, or you can retire safely. What you cannot do is continue to run an independent operation. What would you like to do?"

Dolhen wants a place to lay low for awhile until the heat dies down.

"In that case, let me introduce you to my associate, Caldor," says Hanamir, pointing toward [Cal](/characters/cal/). "He will set you up somewhere."

"Your organization has my loyalty," says Dolhen, "if you can keep me safe." 

He hands over the keys to his hideout. Cal takes him aside to give him directions to [Deladriel](/characters/deladriel/)'s estate.

We decide to loot Dolhen's place before word spreads that Odo died here. The weapons aren’t that interesting, but we do find 3000 gold! Also 4 greater healing potions, 2 superior healing potions, a Potion of Clairvoyance, and a Qualls Feather Token (a feather that, if touched, creates a tree). 

We decide next to venture into Odo’s lair, using the tunnels to head that way. We run into a couple kobolds and goblins along the way, but make our way past them easily in a cool montage of destruction. 

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/), with [Tannin](/characters/tannin/)’s stone cunning help, makes a perception check with advantage. He rolls well, and we get there fairly quickly. We end up at a vault-like door, which we’re pretty sure leads to Odo’s lair. It’s thick, and we won’t be able to hear through it. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) casts Clairvoyance: on the other side of the door, there’s another hallway with two branches off to the side. There’s a small group of standard ne’er-do-wells milling about around the bend, but it’s hard to guess how many there are total since they’re partially obscured. There's at least one drow and one hobgoblin. 

Galadriel opens the door, saunters in, tosses an Odo eyestalk on the floor, and says, “The boss is dead. Long live your new bosses. Us.” 

The henchmen nod at her and walk off. They don’t want any part of this. 

We proceed into the lair, passing Odo’s mirror chamber. In the large central room, we see some guys passed out on some couches, perhaps drunk. None of the lieutenants seem to be present. They have their own areas, so they could be elsewhere in the lair. It’s not clear if anyone knows what happened yet, but we do know that Myn had a sending stone and used it to contact Odo.

Harlan wants to find the quartermaster who can lead us to the assets before things get taken back by the lieutenants. Cal suggests offering everyone a raise in exchange for banding with us against the lieutenants. Galadriel picks up the eyestalk and wears it like a scarf, treating it like a VIP pass to do whatever she wants—and leads the way, not sweating the passed out goons. 

Cal, whose passive perception is the highest, leads the crew into Odo’s mirror chamber. He notices a couple of traps right away: there’s a raised floor plate, and something might spray out of the wall when it’s triggered. Odo was notoriously paranoid, so this all makes sense. 

We come to an ornate set of doors, presumably Odo’s personal chambers. The door is locked. Hanamir takes out his thieves’ tools and takes a look at the lock. With a critical success (27!), the door still does not open. In fact, when the lock clicks into place, we hear a sound… and all must make DEX saves when flame bursts out of the keyhole. [Chunk](/characters/chunk/), Tannin, and Harlan fail, and each take 18 fire damage. The door is still locked, and much warmer than it was before. 

Cal investigates the door to see if there’s a different mechanism to open it. If this door opens from this side, the way to open it isn’t on the door itself. Tannin decides brute force is the way to go. He takes out his portable ram, and, assisted by Hanamir, starts blasting the door with it. Together, they get a 27 (check was 25!) and the door cracks. The spent fire trap rattles out of it and shatters on the floor. 

We are now in Odo’s room, which is more like a dragon's hoard. It is FULL of stuff. Odo, a floating eyeball, doesn’t really need a bed or anything, so it's just literal heaps of treasures. He has a few tokens of rivals he’s vanquished, which are on display. He seems to have had a penchant for gems. All told, we could probably turn the contents of this room into 45,000 gold. And that's not even counting the magic items! This is a jackpot like nothing we’ve ever seen. Chunk pockets a giant ruby just for himself. Hanamir makes notes on all the magical items he finds, which can be found on the [Party Inventory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17gJAAn_-33P-Qk6hNiQ_T-ZnRqZUW2wPNrtEz0wnqfo/edit).

Hanamir, upon taking the Sword of Nine Lives, gets hit with an arrow in the back for 52 (!!!) damage. We barely make out a humanoid figure draped in cloth, crouching behind a piece of the wreckage of the door. 

Galadriel casts Crush Mind on this figure. It passes the INT save, so only takes half damage, resulting in 12 psychic damage. The person then fires back at Galadriel. She’s hit with the crossbow, but passes her CON save, so takes half damage: 20.

Tannin flies into a rage. He rushes to the shattered door and flips it and hurls it. It goes flying. He’s face to face now with a short human woman, Nera Grim. She is Odo’s assassin. She was used for stealth missions, mostly.

Harlan casts Bless on the three damage dealers in the party: Cal, Hanamir, and Tannin. He then casts Spiritual Weapon, materializes it next to Nera, and attacks for 6 dmg.

Cal uses Zephyr Strike to up his movement speed, dashes forward, and uses the new Vicious Rapier on Nera. He does 25 damage.

Chunk casts Lightning. Hits her.

Hanamir dashes forward and hits her, stunning her until the end of his next turn.

We have a strange sensation. We’re looking at the severely wounded Nera Grim. We saw someone appear behind her, possibly elf or drow… and we only saw them very quickly. Just a split second glimpse. And then… the next thing we know, we are alone in this room. There’s no one else here. Nera is gone and this mysterious other person is also gone. It’s as if time has come to a complete stop, they disappeared, and now they’re gone. 

Tannin checks the Orb of Time to see how much time has passed. Turns out it only tells you if it’s morning, afternoon, evening, or night. It’s useless!

Cal runs out of the room to see if he can catch up with anyone with his Zephyr speed. Exiting the front door, he sees a drow wizard carrying the assassin. Hanamir comes too, being a very speedy guy himself. He catches up to the wizard and makes a Stunning Strike, but the wizard passes. He makes a few follow up hits for 32 damage. 

The rest of us hurry to catch up. We recognize the wizard as [Kenoba](/characters/kenoba/), the drow lieutenant. Kenoba reaches for the door, giving Hanamir an attack of opportunity. He makes 9 more damage.

Kenoba turns back and tries to cast Wall of Force, but Galadriel casts Counterspell and blocks it. She then cackles madly at this success and taunts the wizard. 

“Nice try! But you’re outmatched. We killed your boss and we’ll kill you too.” 

She casts Crush Mind, and while he passes the INT save, he still takes 16 damage. An arrow comes flying back at her but misses.

Tannin gets Nera with his trident. Harlan follows up and casts Sacred Flame on Nera; she fails and takes 3 damage. 

Cal summons 4 black bears (fey spirits) to surround the pair. The bears attack. Some go for Nera, some go for Kenoba. They do a bunch of damage.

Chunk casts another Lightning bolt at Kenoba for 33 dmg. 

Hanamir roundhouse kicks Kenoba for 37 damage and says, “There’s a new sheriff in town, brother.” But he's not quite dead.

Kenoba reaches out, grabs Nera’s hand, and the two teleport away.
