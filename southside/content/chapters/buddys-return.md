We start the session with what [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) knows:

He tells us everything. He was captured when we were dealing with the Traveling City (the city that moves between planes). He was captured by Gehennans—the bug people—who delivered him to Lolth. This is the only direct connection we have between Lolth and the Gehennans. He also saw quite a few Yugoloths, the other Gehennans who were acting as go-betweens. From his observations, it seemed as if they served some sort of messenger role. They delivered him, but also several other prisoners, artifacts, etc. to Lolth. They were not necessarily answering to Lolth as much as they were working for somebody that was also working with Lolth.

Originally, the drow tried to subdue Buddy. They tried to turn him into a pet, or something they could use. They thought he’d be useful as leverage, but also as an ally in his own right if they could convert him. After awhile, they realized his power and his unwillingness to be converted, and they kept him in that demi-plane to keep him under control. But before that happened, he was able to learn the gist of what Lolth’s motive was. Lolth is scheming to overthrow the creator of the abyss himself: the chained god Tharizdun. Her followers are obsessed with this idea: they believe their rightful place is ruling the abyss. They do not want to be delegated to the demonweb pits. 

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) asks what this would mean. It would mess with the balance of power in the pantheon, Buddy says. He talks a bit about the current pantheon. Both Pholtus and Obad-hai are dead—whatever that means for gods. Generally disconnected from their domains. [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) sensed this with Obad-hai, because of his connection to nature. Buddy did not learn anything about the Orc gods’ rivalries or of any continued allegiance between Lolth and Shargaas or Gruumsh.

Buddy turns back into his pig form, where he’s most comfortable when not a dragon. :)

Back in Aberith, we check in with [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/)’s whisper network. Word on the street is that there are *two* prices on our heads. Two pretty powerful crime lords felt neglected after making deals with us, and both of them now want us dead. And are willing to pay! [(Cal](/characters/cal/) is not part of this, so he’s ok. Same with Hanamir, who kept himself hidden during these negotiations.)

The political situation hasn’t changed much. The Council is in the same form as it was when we left. [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) is known to be wanted by the underground, so Kir [Mirama](/characters/mirama/) has to keep her distance to avoid suspicion. 

[Goldpeak](/characters/goldpeak/) is now dead, executed for the Sky Arrow crime. :( King [Slee](/characters/slee/) is out of hiding, though. It’s been announced to the city that Goldpeak was part of a coup attempt. There are rumors that we were involved, and that’s why we left town. People who are aware of the bounty on us (Kiln people, generally) are talking about this. 

We hide out in the half-orc monastery/boxing club because our usual haunts are not safe for us. The Black Unicorn could be full of assassins ready to get the bounty on us. On the bright side, we have the upper hand because [Kaz](/characters/kaz/) and [Odo](/characters/odo/) don’t know we’re back yet. 

The large section of the Flats that was destroyed is starting to be rebuilt. They have appointed a commissioner to oversee that. The Council appointed a familiar name - the Cleric of [Kord](/characters/kord/) who restored Harlan’s and Tannin’s hands, [Deru](/characters/deru/) [Nyanceth](/characters/nyanceth/)! She has given up her position at the Kord Temple in favor of this leadership role.

Now we talk amongst ourselves about threads to pursue. Our options include;

The Lich - He’s still down there in the city of the dead! What’s his deal?
[The Messenger](/characters/the-messenger/) 
The AML, broadly - the clown network, the Gehennans
Kaz and Odo
[Kandir](/characters/kandir/) & the Council - Vedit’s debt to him and the consolidation of power

Harlan votes getting our house in order in Aberith—dealing with Kaz and Odo, whatever that means, and the clown situation. Weird creatures from other dimensions messing with everything doesn’t sit right with him. Harlan is also concerned about the Messenger, as the pantheon is his bread and butter. He feels like he owes the people of Aberith something, and wants to help make it better.

Cal is in an odd position—he walked into this accidentally and doesn’t have much of a stake in these ongoing threads. His entire life was spent focused on getting revenge on [Deladriel](/characters/deladriel/), and now that he has done so, he feels listless. He sees a new family in this group, but doesn’t know what kind of direction he should go in. He will meditate on it. 

Hanamir has not yet had to choose between his original motivation and anything else—he still wants justice for the book crime. He still believes the AML and the Messenger are connected. The AML should be uprooted, and working with the state has not worked. Mirama doesn’t know what’s going on, Slee has been in hiding, Kandir’s no good—so, he concludes, we gotta go underground. We gotta wipe out the crime orgs and usurp them. Attack Odo first, with the ultimate goal of going after the AML.

Chunk is pretty content to follow the group’s will. He’s growing into his Druid powers more. 

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) is at a turning point in her life. Her reckless choices have led her here, narrowly escaping a goddess’s wrath and having endangered her friends. She feels older now. Her gauntlet, she realizes, is no longer magically bound to her arm, and she takes it off. She, too, thinks the next priority should be dealing with the crime bosses who want them dead, and then finally getting to the bottom of the AML/Messenger/Lolth connection.
