“You’ll never get me on your side!” [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) screams. “Tell me what’s going on with [Buddy](/characters/buddy/)!”

But [Deladriel](/characters/deladriel/) has no response for her except to kneel down and open his hand, from which a swarm of locusts emerges. A large cloud of buzzing pests centers on Galadriel, [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), and [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) on the roof, and they each must make a CON saving throw. Only Tannin takes the full damage (16), while Hanamir and Galadriel take half (8). The swarm creates a 20-foot sphere of difficult terrain that also slightly obscures vision in the area. The locusts are now all up in our business.

“The dragon is with [Cazna](/characters/cazna/),” says Deladriel’s voice through the swarm. “If you don’t want to deal with me, you’re going to wind up dealing with her.”

“That’s fine!” cries Galadriel, swatting at locusts. “I’ve dealt with her numerous times! To comedic effect!”

“I’m aware of that,” says Deladriel. “We make fun of her a lot back at HQ.”

“Yeah, I bet!” says Galadriel, and she can’t help but laugh a little even as the locusts gnaw at her flesh.

Tannin charges at Deladriel and tackles him. Once he’s on the ground, Tannin holds his arms behind his back in a grapple. In a swift second attack, he reattaches the Dimensional Shackles around Deladriel’s wrists.

“Whoa!” shouts Hanamir. He strikes Deladriel yet again and continues with another of his strange non-sequiturs. “Lolthamania is like a single grain of sand in the Sahara Desert. That is Hanamir Madness.”

From the ground, [Cal](/characters/cal/) can see that Deladriel is close to being done for, and he would love nothing more than to be the one to deal his final blow. He hoists himself up against a windowsill and climbs up the wall until he’s standing on the roof with the others, though he’s keeping his distance from the swarm of locusts as much as possible. He hits Deladriel for another 14 damage, and it’s looking like the end of the line for the nefarious drow priest.

Galadriel casts Suggestion on Deladriel. 

“Tell us everything about your conspiracy,” she says. “Against the innocent people of Aberith, against my dragon friend, against Cal’s village…”

Deladriel, worn down and near to death, succumbs to the spell, and just sort of starts blabbering. 

“Well, I first became aware of you all when you defeated Cazna,” he says. “And I knew that it was you all as soon as I ran into *you*—” he sneers at Galadriel “—with your disguise on. And, well, you know, I'd ordered these Dragonborn to build this tunnel for an attack on the Temple of Liberty…”

“This is all stuff we know,” says Galadriel. “Why the temple? To what end?”

“I am a rare male priest of Lolth,” says Deladriel. “I have been personally tasked by Lolth to carry out her bidding. Where Cazna has fallen out of favor because of her inability to execute… I have become her favored delegate to this plane. Cazna has your dragon friend—‘Buddy,’ I believe you call him—and hopes that he will come in handy. Lolth has been paying attention to what you all have been up to, and she has her own agenda. She’s hoping to advance the cause of the one known as the Messenger. She ordered me to help in any way that I could.”

“Where is Cazna, and where is she keeping Buddy?” asks Galdriel.

“The demonweb pits,” says Deladriel, matter-of-factly.

“How do you get there?” says Galadriel.

Deladriel laughs a little and sighs, as if he doesn’t know where to begin.

“And—so—you’re not the Messenger, then?” Galadriel continues.

“No,” says Deladriel.

“Who is the Messenger?”

“I’ve not met him,” says Deladriel.

“Seems like no one has,” murmurs Galadriel.

At this point, Cal can’t hold back any longer.

“Why did you kill my family?” he demands.

Deladriel turns to glance at him.

“You are going to have to be more specific,” he says.

A vein in Cal’s forehead twitches. In slow, careful words, he describes [the crime that was done to his village](/characters/cal/).

“Ah,” says Deladriel. “Yes. Well, I was a different person then. I hadn’t yet found my true calling. If that’s what this is about, I’d be more than happy to right that wrong. I thought you all were more interested in trying to thwart the Messenger.”

“Right the wrong?” says Cal, his voice shaking. “How do you think you can bring back my family?”

“I can do a lot of things,” says Deladriel. He’s fiddling with the Dimensional Shackles a bit, and Cal is having none of it. He draws his rapier and holds it up to Deladriel’s neck.

“Do it right now, then,” says Cal.

But the offer, it seems, was an empty one, only meant to buy time. In the next moment, a familiar drow figure materializes on the roof.

“Got yourself in a little bit of a bind, Deladriel?” says Cazna.

Deladriel struggles to break free from Tannin’s grapple and fails decisively.

“Just hurry up and get me out of here,” he says.

Cazna chuckles. 

“Funny seeing you here, Cazna,” Galadriel says. “I didn’t think you’d ever set foot on a rooftop again.”

Cazna’s laugh turns into a hiss at this, and she takes a step toward her.

“Careful,” says Tannin. He squeezes Deladriel so forcefully that there’s a faint popping noise, and he falls unconscious.

A yellowish mist surrounds Cazna and she disappears inside it. Tannin can sense that she is trying to influence his mind, but he shakes her off, roaring. 

Hanamir Shadowsteps over to a neighboring building’s balcony. He disentangles himself from a line of drying laundry and then pulls the quiznos from its hidden holster and points it at Cazna.

“Bye, Cazna,” he murmurs.

And she is banished out of this plane.

---

“Wow,” says Tannin, when Hanamir returns, tucking the quiznos away. “I love how Cazna gets interrupted every time she tries to make a scene.”

He’s still holding Deladriel in a death grip. Cal glances down. Without saying anything, he draws his rapier and slowly slides it through Deladriel’s neck.

“That was for my family,” he says.

There is a long, solemn silence. 

It’s interrupted when [Harlan](/characters/harlan/), riding atop Zotz’s back, lands next to them on the rooftop, licking his fingers.

“You guys,” he says, still chewing something, “I found this incredible pierogi cart, you gotta—oh. Whoa. What happened?”

---

Before leaving the warehouse, Hanamir thinks to check the tunnel for any helpful information. There are a few more cots in the tunnel; it seems as though some of the Dragonborn may have been sleeping down there. Among the cots are a few personal effects of the digging crew, including a partially-written letter home to a sibling.

The letter is a little sad, a little disillusioned. “I came to Aberith and was told there would be good work for me,” the Dragonborn writes. “But they just have me digging a tunnel, and I don’t know why. My first night in town, I was stationed at the house of Jao Vedit, an important public figure, and it was the nicest place I’d ever seen. I thought that was what life here would be like. But then I was quickly moved to a different house (it seemed like a real fire hazard) in a rough part of town.”

“Jao Vedit,” murmurs Hanamir. “He owes a debt to Ultas [Kandir](/characters/kandir/), and he’s connected with these Dragonborn… the plot thickens.”

Before leaving, Cal and Tannin work together to set a bomb near the mouth of the tunnel. It explodes as they walk away, and it’s a cool freeze-frame moment.

---

Back at the Black Unicorn, the crew sorts through Deladriel’s possessions. There’s a small golden key to a residence, 400 gold, and a Pearl of Power, which restores one expended spell slot per day.

Galadriel asks Hanamir if she can see the Message scroll. She wracks her brain to see if any of the symbols makes sense to her, and sure enough… “trapped.” One of the symbols means “trapped,” like Buddy, alone somewhere in the demonweb pits, waiting for her. She must rescue him. She *must*.
