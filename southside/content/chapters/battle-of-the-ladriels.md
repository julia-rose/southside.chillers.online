On his way back to the Black Unicorn, [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) sneaks around outside the second Dragonborn HQ. It doesn’t seem like [Krankaad](/characters/krankaad/) has told the others that anything unusual has happened—the four remaining Dragonborn seem to be going about their day and getting ready to head to the tunnel site. Hanamir returns and reports this news to his friends.

The Chillers return to the tunnel site with time to spare. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) casts Disguise Self and transforms not into [Akra](/characters/akra/) (who only speaks Draconic) but Patran, who at least speaks Common. The others find places to hide inside and outside the warehouse: Hanamir disappears into the tunnel itself, along with [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), who has fashioned himself a garment made of pickaxes and other construction materials; [Cal](/characters/cal/), [Harlan](/characters/harlan/), and [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) lurk outside. Galadriel-as[-Patrin](/characters/patrin/) waits inside the warehouse and attempts to look busy.

After some time, the four Dragonborn diggers arrive and encounter Galadriel-as-Patrin. The disguise holds up, and they’re all fooled, at least from a distance across the room.

“Sorry folks. Change of plans. Akra had to go take care of some business, so there’ll be no digging today,” Galadriel-as-Patrin says. “Take the day off. Go have yourselves a drink.”

Three of the Dragonborn accept this eagerly, but the fourth raises an eyebrow.

“Why can’t we keep going?” he says.

“Listen, the boss isn’t paying you to ask questions, okay?” says Galadriel-as-Patrin. “There’s been a complication, and there’ll be no digging today.”

The Dragonborn shrugs and turns to follow his friends, though it seems he remains suspicious. But as they leave the vicinity of the warehouse, they pass by a hooded figure they seem to recognize. Cal recognizes him too.

There is a short exchange between this figure and the Dragonborn, and while no one can hear what’s said, the hooded figure gestures to the Dragonborn to stay put. He approaches the building and lowers his hood. He enters, and Galadriel-as-Patran finds herself staring down an objectively scary-looking drow, Lord [Deladriel](/characters/deladriel/) himself.

“Where’s Akra?” he asks.

“There’s been a problem with the tunnel,” Galadriel-as-Patran says, noticing her heart beating faster. She gestures toward the opening, where she has cast a Minor Illusion of a small cave-in. “I told the boys to take the day off while we get this figured out.”

“But again,” says Deladriel, slowly, “where is Akra?”

Unbeknownst to either of them, Hanamir has used a dose of Invisibility Powder from the Quiznos temple, and has quietly snuck Cal inside. Before entering, Cal set up his second wondrous lion figurine and the construct trap from [Bracket](/characters/bracket/)’s workshop.

“Well,” says Galadriel-as-Patrin, “she went to acquire more scaffolding materials. As you know, she’s been given the bare minimum of resources and been told to continue the mission. So she’s off doing what needs to be done to get this cave-in fixed.”

Deladriel stares, skeptical but unable to find fault with Patrin or his story (Galadriel rolled really high on Deception). He pulls up a chair and takes a seat.

“Well, I think I’ll wait here for her, then,” he says. At this point, Galadriel notices that he wears a Lolth insignia not unlike the one on her own gauntlet.

Several minutes go by, and Galadriel-as-Patrin struggles to come up with convincing busywork to do while Deladriel observes her with seeming amusement.

Meanwhile, outside, the Dragonborn are surprised by the golden lion and the construct advancing on them from out of nowhere. The lion pounces first and knocks one down, while another comes to his aid. Another Dragonborn uses his cone of ice breath on the lion, which dodges admirably and only takes a partial blast. But the lion and the construct are outnumbered, and the Dragonborn quickly rally and attack the lion until it returns to its stone figurine form and drops to the ground.

The commotion outside draws Deladriel’s attention. He goes to the door and looks outside, then glances back at Galadriel-as-Patrin.

“That was quick,” he says.

“What are you talking about, sir?” says Galadriel-as-Patrin.

Deladriel smiles. Galadriel, feeling cocky, smiles back, baring her many Dragonborn teeth.

Unceremoniously, Tannin jumps up from his concealed spot in the tunnel. There’s a clattering of pickaxes and prospector pans, followed by an impressive Dwarven roar, and Tannin launches into a rage, aiming his trident at Deladriel. His aim is true, and he deals a whole mess of damage right off the bat.

Hanamir’s invisibility has finally worn off, and he too goes straight into an attack, dealing 15 bludgeoning damage to Deladriel with a swift kick in the head. Cal then casts Hunter’s Mark on Deladriel and then lands two strikes himself for a total of 38 damage. 

Deladriel’s eyes turn into an inky void. He looks at Cal for a moment, and then Cal drops to the floor, unconscious. Then he turns to Galadriel-as-Patrin.

“Now’s your chance to save your friend,” he says.

“What?!” says Galadriel, sputtering. “What do you mean? I—I don’t know this guy. What did you do to him?”

Deladriel stares at her with his inky black eyes, and she has the sense that he’s not talking about Cal, but a different friend.

Tannin hits Deladriel with another double attack, and while he catches his breath, he roars loudly in Cal’s ear. It fails to wake him up.

Meanwhile, outside, the construct is giving the Dragonborn a hard time. It keeps slipping between their legs and barely evading their grasp. But the noise coming from the battle inside is now loud enough that they turn their attention that way and rush in. Seeing Deladriel under attack, two of them restrain Cal while two of them attack Tannin.

Hanamir slashes Deladriel for 15 damage and then Shadowsteps to stand next to Cal, kicking him awake. He’s still restrained by the two Dragonborn, but he is at least conscious again. He makes a strength check and is able to wriggle free of his captors.

Galadriel casts Fear on the two Dragonborn surrounding Cal. They both fail their saving throws, and see a vision of an ancient red dragon swooping down at them. They drop their things and flee immediately. Galadriel also grants Bardic Inspiration to Cal.

Deladriel turns to Galadriel again. 

“Wrong choice,” he says.

And in the next moment, his back splits open and legs start spilling out of him, until he’s a giant spider. (Galadriel’s heart sinks. She cannot attack him in this form due to her gauntlet’s curse.)

Deladriel then makes a bite attack at Tannin. It lands, but Tannin’s resistance to poisoning and piercing means he takes less damage than he otherwise would have.

Deladriel then flees the warehouse, but not before Tannin lands an attack of opportunity. Hissing, Deladriel climbs up the side of the building onto the roof. Tannin is frustrated by this, but turns his attention to the two remaining Dragonborn in the warehouse. He and Cal fight these two, trading vicious blows and bouts of ice breath.

Hanamir Shadowsteps up to the rooftop to follow Deladriel. With the element of surprise on his side, Hanamir succeeds in landing a flurry of unarmed strikes at Deladriel’s hideous spider body until he is stunned and unable to move. Galadriel hurries after Hanamir and spider-climbs up the side of the building to join this fray. She reaches the rooftop to see Hanamir using the Dimensional Shackles on two of Deladriel’s legs.

“Where’s [Buddy](/characters/buddy/)?” she snarls, dropping all pretense of her Patrin disguise.

The spider hisses back at her. 

“You had your chance to save him,” Deladriel says. “You had your chance to pick sides in this fight. Take the shackles off me and I will bring you to him.”

“I can’t betray my friends,” she says. “What do you mean, I had a chance to save him?”

“You had your chance, and now you’ll watch all your friends suffer,” says Deladriel.

He then casts a spell on Hanamir. A twisted crown of jagged iron appears over Hanamir’s head. Madness glows in his eyes.
