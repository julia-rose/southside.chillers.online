# Selling parts, buying potions

We go to Squawker, the Kenku who bought our basilisk corpse, to sell our manticore and wyvern parts salvaged from the battle.

- The manticore parts are not in best condition, but he offers 100 gold for them. 
- The two wyvern heads excite him a lot. He has an argument with himself out loud before settling on 500 gold for the two. 
- So we net 600 gold total from these parts! Now we have 1350 gold, and we're feeling good about that.

We talk about getting some health potions. Since there's still a ban buying and selling magical items in Aberith, we discuss where to go. There might be some sketchy potions available in the Kiln, or perhaps there's some kind of way around the ban if you know who to ask?

- "Like, maybe it's prescription only, but you just have to say you have headaches," notes Tannin. 
- Squawker advises us that there is a potionmaker uptown who often buys parts of magical creatures from him (illicitly). He gives us a name (Telura) and address up in Silver Hill. 

We go directly there. It's a fancy-looking storefront that seems to sell valuable items made of crystal; its clientele are all rather hoity-toity. Tannin's casual attire (loincloth, no shoes) garners some disapproving looks. A woman who matches the description Squawker gave us (elf woman of about 300, looks 70 by human standards) is sitting at a table near the back.

**Galadriel:** Good morning, ma'am, might your name be Telura?

**Telura:** ...Pardon me, dear?

Galadriel repeats herself, a little louder. 

**Telura:** Ah, yes! I am Telura. Are you interested in any of my curiosities?

She gestures out to the crystal trinkets and things.

**Harlan:** They are beautiful, but we were thinking something more... consumable. Something you drink? A... refreshment?

**Telura:** A drink? I don’t need a drink.

**Galadriel:** I believe we might have a mutual friend, someone who provides you with items of an exotic nature… Squawker?

**Telura:** The bird?

**Galadriel:** Yes, yes, the bird man!

**Telura:** Oh, he sent you, did he? Did you bring the wings? He said he was going to bring me some wings.

**Galadriel:** Uh... not today, I'm afraid.

**Harlan:** But we do bring gold! 

**Telura:** Oh! Gold! Why didn’t you say so? What is it that you’d like to purchase?

Tannin pulls out a health potion from the Bag of Holding.

**Tannin:** We want some pick 'em uppers, and we want some put 'em downers, too.

Telura procures several bottles of various sizes. She has quite a few. On the table, she puts a healing potion, a greater healing potion, and an even larger one (superior healing) next to those. She looks at Tannin and then puts a different bottle slightly apart from them. It looks identical. She smiles at us.

**Telura:** Now, don’t get ‘em mixed up! 

She pulls out one more bottle. This one is filled with a blue and bubbling liquid. 

**Telura:** Perhaps one of these as well? Really, anything you’d like.

**Galadriel:** Can you describe to us the effects of this blue one?

**Telura:** Yes. It makes you feel like a real hero, I hear. I’ve never had one myself. It might make you feel a little bit more resilient.

**Tannin:** *(whispering)* I wanna spend all our money here.

Harlan points to the bottle set aside from the healing potions.

**Harlan:** And what's this one?

**Telura:** Well, he said downers, too.

**Galadriel:** If I were to dip an arrow into that and shoot it at someone who was attacking me, what would happen to them?

**Telura:** Hmm. It might add a little bit of spice to your arrows. Now, I could also craft something for you if you have something in mind.

**Galadriel:** Ooh, a bespoke potion master!

**Hanamir:** Could you create a potion of invisibility?

**Telura:** I could, indeed, young man.

**Harlan:** What are we talking here, pricewise?

**Telura:** For invisibility, that would be 800 gold. The healing potions are 50 for regular, 150 for greater. 450 for superior.

**Hanamir:** Let’s do it. 

We buy the invisibility potion along with three greater healing potions and one regular healing potion. 

**Telura:** I’ll throw in one more regular healing potion for free.

**Galadriel:** You’re chill as hell, ma'am.

Telura notices Harlan’s ring of featherfall. 

**Telura:** A man like you might want a potion like this.

She pulls out a light blue potion and says it “gives you wings.” It might be Red Bull? 

**Telura:** Flight. It’s 800 gold. 

**Harlan:** Unless you have a layaway program, I think I’m good for now, but thank you. By the way, since you're in the neighborhood—do you happen to know Old Toby?

**Telura:** Yes… you mean, the young man with the pet? What do you want with him?

**Galadriel:** We heard he knows everyone around here.

**Telura:** You know, I’ve lived in Silver Hill a long time, too.

Galadriel rolls insight to see if Telura is cool, or if she’s got an ulterior motive. It’s tough to get a full read on her since her hearing and memory aren't great, but... she’s operating an illegal potion shop in Silver Hill. She’s probably aware of the underworld in Aberith; she’s not senile, but seems forgetful. Galadriel decides to go for it.

**Galadriel:** Do you know anyone by the name of Kaz?

**Telura:** Hmm, hmm, the name’s familiar. Yes, the rich one. The owner of the Prismatic Inn. They call him Kaz sometimes. Why are you looking for him?

At this point, Chunk just spills the beans on our whole deal, says we’re trying to clear our friend’s name, and that we need information from Kaz to do so. LOL.

**Telura:** ...I wish you the best of luck!

**Tannin:** By the way, what kind of wings are you looking for? We could get them for you.

**Telura:** He said he'd have manticore wings.

**Tannin:** Aha. Those might be coming your way soon.

We loudly thank her and leave. We head for the Prismatic Inn to go talk to Old Toby.

# The return of Argentum Blunderbuss and Gaia von Hastings

Before reaching the Prismatic Inn, Galadriel casts Disguise Self and becomes her alter ego from Goldpeak's art gala, Gaia von Hastings; Harlan adopts his own alter ego, Argentum Blunderbuss. Tannin plans to hang outside the place watching the front entrance—there's a dwarven vendor with a food cart nearby he could chat with. Chunk decides to enter separately from Galadriel and Harlan and provide backup if needed. He dresses up in his idea of fancy dress—wearing two monocles at once and an ill-fitting suit. Hanamir is hiding in the adjoining alley, waiting and watching for any suspicious figures entering or leaving.

Galadriel and Harlan go in. There’s one guy sitting at the bar and lounge area who seems likely to be Toby; he’s having a lively conversation, holding court with three others. He’s telling them some story about some exploit of his—this one involves skeletons—and he's clearly embellishing or inventing most of it, but no one minds. 

- Old Toby’s hair is long and gray and luscious.
- He looks like Mr. Peanut in human form, with long beautiful gray hair. 

Harlan approaches him with confidence.

**Harlan:** Toby, you old so-and-so! It’s been forever! Your adventures are renowned, a finer fortune-hunter we’ve never seen. 

He tosses a cocktail peanut in his mouth and leans against the bar. Toby, taken aback, scans Harlan's face.

**Toby:** Remind me who you are, again?

**Harlan:** Oh Toby, you old codger, it’s been too long. Argentum! Argentum Blunderbuss. *(turning toward the bar)* Barkeep! Get this man another drink! And my delightful companion, don’t believe you’ve met—

**Galadriel:** Gaia von Hastings! Enchanted, I’m sure!

Her Disguise Self spell holds up to Toby's inspection. 

**Toby:** Pleasure to meet you, madam.

She offers him her hand, and he kisses it. He seems a little confused, but willing to roll with whatever is happening. Chunk is sitting at the bar, not getting involved, but seeming to enjoy the wine spritzer he ordered.

**Toby:** Well, then, what brings you to town?

**Harlan:** Toby, my friend, we’re in town seeking adventurers for our latest endeavor. And as you are the source of knowledge—you know everyone in this city—you’re our first stop.

The guys he was talking to are looking at Toby expectantly. After his tall tales, he has to respond.

**Toby:** Ah, of course you’d come to me first! We should discuss the specifics, but I’m on board, of course.

**Harlan:** Lovely! Glad to hear it! Drinks for the whole table! Are these your current adventuring companions?

Toby introduces us to his drinking companions. These are just three people traveling through town. They’re less interested in hanging out now—they'll take the free drink, but they step aside to their own table after a few pleasantries.

**Galadriel:** Now that we have you to ourselves, Toby, my companion and I would love to discuss with you any promising adventurers who might have come across your path of late. People of note who may have access to…

Now Toby looks offended; he thought we were asking *him* to join.

**Harlan:** Oh Toby! Of course you realize that we intend for you to lead this adventure yourself. But of course, one man is not an army. You must have a party. But we came to you first for information, because, you see, we are pursuing people who may have stolen something from this very inn.

Toby is intrigued, but he was actually sort of relieved before when he thought he didn’t have to be involved. Now he’s concerned again. It’s a real roller coaster for old Toby.

**Toby:** Something stolen from the inn? Are you contracted by the proprietor?

**Harlan:** The information that we have is rather discreet… and we don’t happen to be familiar with the prorprietor of this inn; we only know the stolen item came from here. Do you happen to know him? Perhaps you could make an introduction.

**Toby:** Of course, of course. But what was stolen?

**Harlan:** In these uncertain times… when certain items are contraband... I wouldn’t want to sully anyone’s good name by mentioning things in a public place. But valuble it is indeed.

**Toby:** Perhaps we ought to retire to my room to discuss this further.

**Galadriel:** As long as we can bring a bottle of sparkling elven wine?

Toby asks the barkeep to send this to his room. Harlan cringes as the price is read—20 gold. We only have 50 left. Toby shows Harlan and Galadriel the way upstairs to his suite, which he lives out of. 

Meanwhile, Chunk is loving his wine spritzer. He didn’t know you could do this to grapes! He loves it. Once the others are upstairs, he ducks outside and updates Hanamir and Tannin. He then turns into a squirrel and climbs up the side of the building, hoping to find the room where Toby lives. Tannin keeps watch over front entrance and Hanamir stays near the back.

# A private meeting in the salamander room

**Toby:** I think this will allow us more privacy to discuss the matter at hand. I would be happy to make an introduction to the owner of this establishment. First, help me understand what it is that we’re after.

**Harlan:** Well, you see… as we were traveling into town, we came upon some rather unscrupulous fellows moving a large chest. We ended up speaking with them, and it went a little bit pear shaped when they tried to rob us. The chest they carried, as it happens, was labeled Property of the Prismatic Inn. Now, we have not frequented this establishment, but we knew of it, of course. And this surprised us, since these people did not seem authorized to have this property. There was one dark magic user in the back, dressed as... a clown? I don’t know how else to describe it. I found it most distasteful. But he summoned this beast, a—what was it called, Gaia—a wyvern! To attack us! 

**Galadriel:** Yes, a wyvern! Dreadful! Dreadful!

**Toby:** This wyvern, what happened to it?

**Harlan:** We fled, initially. Found shelter in a cave. And eventually... were able to defeat it. 

He shows off the wyvern claw that he has tied around his neck.

**Toby:** The two of you?? 

**Harlan:** Ohohoho no, well, of course, as people of means, we always travel with an entourage. We do employ a few trained individuals.

**Toby:** This is most interesting. I’m sure that the owner would probably know what went missing and would be able to recognize the chest as you described it. Unfortunately, he’s not presently available. But as I’ve taken up a residence here, we’ve become close friends, and occasionally I will act in his stead in an unofficial capacity. I’d be glad to both help pursue this, but also to pass along the information once he returns from his trip.

**Harlan:** That is most gracious of you, but you must tell us—clearly Gaia and I are the enterprising sort—is this person… what did you say his name was?

**Toby:** His name is Kaz.

**Harlan:** Kaz, yes. Would he be willing to pay for the return of his goods?

**Toby:** He’s a generous man. He values good work. I’m sure he’d be more than generous if you were able to return his things to him.

**Harlan:** Yes, we’d need to go procure it from these ruffians.

**Toby:** These ruffians, what did they look like?

**Galadriel:** The most fearsome one was dressed as a clown. A clown, Toby!

**Harlan:** Have you ever heard of such a thing? Are there clowns running around this city?

Toby excuses himself, leaving us alone in his room for about ten minutes. Taking a cursory look around the room, we see a big rectangle with a sheet over it. Galadriel peeks under the sheet. Inside, there is an 8 foot long salamander, emanating considerable heat, that he seems to keep as a pet. It’s sleeping. Galadriel lowers the sheet.

Toby returns after a few minutes. He’s holding a clown robe. It’s the robe of the con woman form the gala, Lady Platernia. 

**Harlan:** My word! These are not the same colors that our scoundrel wore, but the style is similar. Where did you obtain this?

**Toby:** Someone around town causing mischief has taken to wearing this disguise. I could bring you to her. Seems we have a copycat in our midst.

**Galadriel:** Unless they were coordinated somehow…

**Harlan:** You don’t think Kaz is involved, do you?

**Toby:** Stealing from himself?

**Harlan:** No, associating with the clowns. Often there’s a bit of infighting in these operations…

**Toby:** I think these questions are better left for a time when Kaz can speak for himself. Why don’t you stay here tonight, free of charge? I am glad to make the arrangements for you. The room across the hall from mine should do. I am confident he’ll be back tomorrow.

Harlan casts Detect Thoughts. He can hear Toby's surface thoughts: he’s nervous, and he feels overcommitted and worried that the overcommitment will ruin something. Harlan then casts Suggestion, but Toby seems to resist it. 

**Harlan:** Thank you Toby, old friend. You are a gentleman of wit and valor.

**Galadriel:** Yes, of course we accept. 

**Toby:** If there’s nothing else, I must attend to my pet.

**Harlan:** Yes indeed. Gaia, care for a stroll around the quarter?

**Galadriel:** Yes, yes, of course, Argentum. Thank you, Toby.

From the windowsill, Chunk continues watching. He sees Toby remove the heat blanket and remove something from his satchel—it looks like it’s an animal’s leg, maybe a lion's... or a manticore's. He throws it into the cage. The salamander devours it, and then settles back down to sleep.
