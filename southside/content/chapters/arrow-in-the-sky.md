We’re at [Mirama](/characters/mirama/)’s house. [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) keeps watch on the roof, assuming that the War has Begun.

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) sits down with [Slee](/characters/slee/) and asks him what resources he has to call upon. Slee’s immediate concern is [Kandir](/characters/kandir/) and the extent of the threat. 

“He said he would ‘take what’s yours’,” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). “What did that refer to? The kingdom?”

“I have an idea of what that could be, but I don’t know what Kandir wants with it,” says Slee, cautiously. He’s eyeing the people he hasn’t met in this room. 

We take him aside to speak privately, and he continues. “He could have meant the kingdom. But as my memories return, I realize… even in my coerced state, there were things I would not give him, that I kept in a safe place only I know about. Only Kings of Aberith know how to access the chamber they are kept in. He may have been referring to something in that chamber.”

“How did he find out about those things?” says Harlan. 

“I’m not sure,” says Slee. “Kandir was aware that there was a room that was not accessible to him. There are no doors in or out. You can teleport in or out if you’ve been there before. But otherwise, you’d have to know where in the castle it was and remove the walls.”

“You don’t have to tell us how, sir, but do you have a way of accessing it still?” Harlan says.

“Yes,” says Slee. 

“Is it related to the Order of the Been?” says Galdriel.

“No, this is Aberith royalty only,” says Slee. “The secrets of Aberith are in there. The power that built Aberith.”

“The… power, you say?” says Galadriel.

She shows him the Message scroll. Slee doesn’t know what to make of it. He was aware of the Messenger, but this is a crazy superstitious cult with weird beliefs about gods, not something he’s really familiar with. Slee takes a look at the symbols, including the one for “power” that was tattooed on the Dragonborn we fought. 

The symbol that means “artifacts/toys”—Slee says he recognizes that as part of an ancient language. He’s seen it before. The people on this continent long before Aberith—he believes this is their language. Probably some of the people of the culture that built the Quiznos ruins. They wielded enormous power for a time, but then fell to it. 

“And what of this threat at the end of the week? Is that resolved?” says Slee.

We look at each other skeptically. No one wants to be the one to say that we have zero clue what the threat at the end of the week is.

Hanamir reappears, satisfied that there is no imminent threat to Mirama’s house, and we fill him in on Slee’s theory.

“We could try to secure the items in the secret room,” says Hanamir.

“Yes!” says [Cal](/characters/cal/). “So, storm the castle?”

“Or, first, we could first figure out how to detect Ultroloths among us,” says Harlan, “to scope out any other secret AML members.”

“Remember, there are genuine followers of the AML,” says Mirama. “Aberith natives who believe in the cause. They were brought in by political promises, not because they’re Gehennans.” 

How did word about this secret chamber get out, we wonder? Slee says maybe it’s been legend for many years—a previous king, perhaps, told someone, who told someone, and so on. He knows he himself never said anything. Mind-reading, though? Maybe.

We also tell him about the statue chamber, and speculate on who might be imprisoned there.

“Oh, that sounds like the Statuary,” says Slee. “It’s in the castle.”

We bring Profeus back into the conversation and inform him of this. He confirms he could teleport us there, if we wished.

—

We take a short rest and plan our strike team into the castle. We’ll show up, being as stealthy as possible, to protect Slee while he retrieves the contents of his secret room.

As we approach the castle at a distance, we hear a loud sound like a train whistle. We see something flying straight up into the sky over the spires of the palace—like an arrow being fired. As the arrow falls, it looks normal at first… but then we see stones starting to form in the air around it, as if they’re meteors several hundred feet above. These meteors come crashing down, centered on the castle itself. Then we all must make DEX saves as the blast waves from what we now realize must be the Sky Arrow radiate outward from the center of impact.

Harlan uses his Glove of Missile Snare to reduce the damage he takes from falling rocks. Hanamir uses Deflect Missile for the same effect. All of us are hit pretty badly with shrapnel. Cal, Profeus, and Jao Vedit are unconscious. Slee doesn’t take damage because two Amber Guardsmen died protecting him, leaving only four Guards left. Mirama is hurt but awake.

Harlan stabilizes Cal. Hanamir rushes in toward the currently-imploding castle after checking with Slee. Galadriel polymorphs into a Giant Ape, rips a flag off a pole, and turns it into a baby bjorn and carries Slee like a baby. [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) turns into a normal ape. 
Galadriel rolls a nat 20 + 2 (Giant Ape DEX) to scale the rubble of the castle while holding Slee. When they approach the place Slee says is near the secret room, we see two Amber Guardsmen looking suspicious, digging through the ruins as if searching for something. Galadriel makes two fist attacks, and hits one of them for 26 dmg, bringing him close to death.

A tower crumbles and does some damage to Harlan and Chunk in ape form. Two more Amber Guardsmen come up behind the crew.

Slee climbs down out of Ape-Galadriel’s arms to dig through the wreckage to find what he’s looking for. 

Cal attacks one of the Amber Guardsmen near him and instructs his drake to attack the other one. Harlan casts Bless on Cal, Hanamir, [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), and the Giant Ape. (With Bless, for any attack roll or saving throw, add a d4.) With his bonus action, he casts Spiritual Weapon and makes an attack against the first Amber Guardsman targeted by Cal (however, his spell misses).

Cal attacks the Amber Guardsman for 24 damage on the first one, but the drake misses his attack on the second one.

The first Amber Guardsman casts Cone of Cold on the group (Cal, Harlan, and Chunk—Hanamir is far enough ahead). All take 17 damage except Chunk, who takes 34—and is knocked back to his firbolg form. 

The second Amber Guardsman casts Stone Skin on himself so now he’s extra tough (though not a statue). 

Galadriel makes two more fist attacks at the Amber Guardsmen near her and Slee. She kills one of them and does 22 dmg to the other one. Slee is still rummaging through the rubble. But climbing up through another pile of broken stone, holding a small golden box, is none other than Mr. Ultas Kandir… now confirmed to be human and native to this plane.
