The next morning, we all wake up and the dwarves are still there, milling about. It doesn’t seem like anything’s amiss (and they haven’t noticed their swapped texts). [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) looks at the Cube, and sees that it has changed from Control Water to Flame Arrows. 

The most talkative dwarf, Heggeck, takes [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) aside and says, “We really appreciated the donation you were able to make. We were talking, and… we were wondering if perhaps… I hate to ask this… but perhaps we could get a little bit more? Just enough to get us from here to the city. We’d be happy to try to repay that at some future time, but so few have been generous to us that we’re in the uncomfortable position of having to ask again. If you could spare maybe 30 gold, we could get to our destination without having to rely on others as generous as yourself.”

“Our money decisions usually all go through our treasurer,” says Chunk, before realizing that [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) still hasn’t revealed himself to these Dwarves. “How would you pay us back?”

“We’d repay the favor at some point,” says Heggeck. 

Chunk thinks. “Okay,” he says. He gives Heggeck the 30 gold.

Heggeck is overjoyed, and goes to tell the others. The bard of the group begins to compose a song in our honor. “I’ll keep working on it as we travel,” he says, strumming on his lute. 

With that, they’re on their way.

Hanamir reappears once they’re gone and tells everyone what he did. As soon as he does so, [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) grabs him by the shoulders and chants “Mirror of the Past! Mirror of the Past!”

He finds the oldest document of the bunch and points the MotP at it. These aren’t original documents, but they’ve been handed down for generations, at least. We see them scribed by a Dwarf, copied down from another text. From what we can see, there are some recognizable words but also a smattering of untranslated text. It seems to tell a specific story of the encounters of the Children. Hanamir tries to cross-reference and glean as much detail as he can from the Dwarvish annotations.

We continue walking through the forest. Hanamir rolls 21 perception. The growth in this forest is new—and very fresh, as if a disproportionate amount of this forest sprang up overnight, or at least within the last few months. Perhaps there has been an influx of light to this area, where before there had been less. 

“Does this seem odd to you?” Hanamir asks Chunk. 

Chunk looks around. “It’s a more moist type of growth, as if the climate is shifting,” he says. “The place has gotten substantially more water lately than it had before.”

The walk is uneventful—we see occasional evidence of encounters, a stray arrow, an abandoned satchel… but not much else. We see the occasional creature. The owlbears seem to know to leave us alone. 

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/)’s on edge, looking around for natural threats. He rolls 22 perception. There are some traps along the path, but they’ve all been sprung. The raiding seems to have died down, or someone must have cleared the area. 

By the third trap, we see evidence of a victim: a dead elf lying at the bottom of a pit. They seem to have been dead for several days at least. Cause of death seems to have been the fall itself. They’re not carrying anything on them—presumably if they had anything, it’s already been looted. This person doesn’t look dressed like a noble. 

Harlan says a few words. “May [Istus](/characters/istus/) welcome you into the next plane,” he says. As respectfully as possible, he takes the corpse out of the hole and leans it against a tree, and then casts Speak with Dead.

The corpse is disoriented and a little scared. 

“What have you done to me?” the corpse says. 

“We’ve briefly brought you back, because I’m sorry to tell you, you have died,” says Harlan. “But you can leave this land doing a last service to your fellow living people by answering our questions. What were you doing here?”

“I was walking through the forest,” says the corpse. “The last thing I remember is hearing a loud ‘pop’. But I was simply on my way to gather some mushberries.”

“Why has the weather changed here recently?” says Harlan.

“The rains have been very intense,” says the corpse. “For some months now. It’s made the mushberries all the more mushy.” 

“Who set these traps?” says Harlan.

“There have been cases of bandits ambushing people,” says the elf. “But I haven’t encountered anyone.”

“Do you have any unresolved personal issues? Anyone we can visit and inform of your fate?” says Harlan.

“Yes, a brother, Tairoy,” says the corpse. “My name is B’ernii. Would you tell him? He’s in Peloria.”

“What is the strangest thing you’ve seen recently?” says Harlan.

“I saw a face in the mist several weeks ago,” he says. “I heard stories… I assumed that they were just urban legends… but I saw some kind of face one day on my morning walk. I must admit it stuck with me. When you ask of the strangest thing, that stands out. Many have seen similar things, and I wrote them off… but I couldn’t stop thinking about how real it looked.” 

“May Istus bless you, B’ernii,” says Harlan. 

Hanamir puts the body in the portable hole, to bring him to his brother.

We set up camp, near the edge of the lake, still about a 6-hour walk from Peloria. We take a short rest. 

During Tannin’s watch shift, he sees something he hasn’t seen in a long time. It’s the unmistakable shape of a Water Elemental, swimming about in the lake. Tannin, having spent some time on the elemental plane of Water, would recognize this. It doesn’t seem to be aware of him. It’s just playing in the water. 

Tannin decides to dive into the lake and play with the Elemental. There’s more than one! This lake is actually teeming with them—at least a dozen that Tannin can make out. They actually make up a substantial amount of this lake. They look like waves. They’re swimming and splashing off of one another. They seem to take kindly to the fact that Tannin is joining them in a good-natured way. It’s kind of like a mosh pit. Despite this feeling like a rush of water coming at you, this is not meant to be hostile. 

“It’s been so long since I’ve played Water Mosh!” says Tannin, speaking in rusty Aquan. “Since I was on the water plane, in fact. How long have you all been here?”

They reply collectively, as they swim past. “You’ve been to the Source?!”

Two others respond to the question. “We keep being pulled here. But one or two at a time. We wish to go home. We’ve been here too long.”

“Hmm. I will need to talk to my companions. I don’t have a way of getting back there, and my situation was very specific, it’s a long story…” Tannin says. He decides to consult with Hanamir during the change of watch.

The lake comes to life at night, and becomes very turbulent with the elementals splashing about. 

“They said they were being pulled here,” says Hanamir. “Do you think there’s a portal at the bottom of the lake? Something else of note around here?”

“Great question,” says Tannin. “I can walk back there and ask them now. Do you think we should wake up the rest of the group?”

“Yeah, why not?” says Hanamir. He goes to shake everyone awake.

“Guys, guys, water elementals over there.” 

We all go and look. To most of us, it looks just like a lake that is acting oddly (very turbulent for a normally still body of water). 

Fibsy checks arcana. There are a lot of ways to get Elementals to this plane: a wizard could bring them here, they could be summoned or conjured. They’ve described it as being “pulled” and they can’t seem to get back, which suggests that there’s not just a portal they could go back through. 

“Based on my travels, I do not think this is a voluntary excursion on their part, but the machinations of malevolent force have brought them here against their will,” says Fibsy.

Tannin asks the Elementals if something’s trying to coerce them into doing anything, or if they’re just free to frolic and play.

“We’ve been given free rein to do what we wish in the lake, but there just seem to be more and more of us drawn here, with no sense of why,” say the Elementals.

“It is possible that the increase in Elementals corresponds to the increase in moisture in this forest,” says Fibsy. 

“When you come here, do you come in through the bottom of the lake? The sky? Is it the same every time? What do you know of how you get here?” asks Tannin.

One of them makes as much of a gesture as it can—toward a large cloud that has been sitting over the lake this whole time.

“We all come from there,” it says. 

Hanamir (with his cloak) flies up to the cloud, followed by Harlan (on Zotz) and Fibsy (using the spell Fly). He goes above the cloud to see what he can see. With 26 percepetion, he perceives a large face—the face of a creature perhaps 16 feet tall. It’s a large fish-like face. There’s a large fish man body as well. He’s lying on the cloud but also is part of it? It’s confusing. 

“Good sir or madam, I do not mean to interrupt your slumber, but is it possible we could parlay?” says Fibsy.

The cloud begins to condense into more and more of a solid creature until standing before them is one of the largest creatures we’ve ever encountered. This gigantic fish cloud man thing now looks more fish than cloud. 

“Who dares wake the Great Typhis?”

“Pardon the imposition, your greatness, my name is Fibonacci Sequins, and you may call me Fibsy if you choose. My friends and I happened to notice a number of individuals below you in the lake not native to this area who wish to return home, and we wondered if there was something we could help you with, whatever your current predicament may be.”

“My business here is my own, and unless you’d like to join the lake, then I have no desire to speak with air breathers,” says Typhis.

“I understand, I do not like to be woken from a slumber myself. I like a good dip, I used to do so down in the hollow. Your presence does seem to be calling ill effects in this area, undue stress, and I think we could resolve that and accomplish your goals as well.”

“Ill effects? What would an air breather such as your self describe as ill effects?”

“An abundance of humidity, I will say, which is uncomfortable for those of us who breathe air. And the plant growth and vegetation is unnatural here.”

“I find it quite comfortable,” says Typhis. With one of his hands moving, a large wave sprays, and the rest of the party gets misted.

“I think it is time for you to leave this land, unless you can give me a good reason why you are here,” says Fibsy. His vibe is supposed to be persuasive. Tyhpis laughs off the attempt at persuasion.

“I didn’t realize I was making things uncomfortable for you all,” he says. He begins to make it rain, fairly heavily. He laughs to himself, and doesn’t seem super bothered by Fibsy’s potential threat.

Hanamir intervenes. 

“So sorry, sir, for my hot-headed friend. Our leader is a water-breather, and he would like to speak with you. Unfortunately he cannot fly.”

The fish turns to water, back to lake, then back to fish, and appears at the lake’s coast, and stands face to face with those of us on the ground. The upper half of his fish body is out above the water line.

“Which one of you all is the water breathing leader I have heard about?” says Typhis.

Tannin raises his hand and speaks in Aquan.

“Uh, that would be me. Leader, and water breather. Check and check.”

Typhis speaks to Tannin in Aquan. “Where did you learn to speak this tongue?”

“I understand your surprise. Many of my kind are not water breathers, but I was taken in on the water plane.” He relays some of his story to Typhis. “I’m familiar with the ways of that plane.”

“You would be a particularly good addition to the lake here. Perhaps I could encourage you to stay with us.” He makes a welcoming gesture, parting some of the water to invite him in.

“What do you mean, stay with us? I’ve got places to be, things I was doing. You seem nice enough and everything, but I’m not looking for a commitment right now.” 

“Since you’ve visited our home, you understand how beautiful it is… I myself cannot return there, so I would like to make this area just as beautiful. Surely you see the value in replacing all of this with something as beautiful as the plane that was so welcoming and kind to take you in.”

“It was a beautiful plane, that is for sure. I do not think we can change one plane into another, no matter how many drops of water you add here. You’ll never take over the prime material plane,” says Tannin. “Why were you banished? Maybe you can return.”

Some irritation is evident. 

“Perhaps I should demonstrate what I can and cannot do,” says Typhis.

He picks three of us: Galadriel, Harlan, and Chunk. A big jet of water comes out of the lake and flies straight at us. The three of them roll DEX saves; Harlan and Galadriel pass (12 dmg) while Chunk fails (24 dmg). Chunk is also pushed back 20 feet. 

“Everything that you see here is under my control, and I would suggest that if these air breathers mean something to you, that you take my offer and join me,” says Typhis.

We roll initiative. Fibsy is up first, casting Suggestion. “Good sir, I can no longer tolerate your buffoonery. I suggest you go bring water to the desert.”

The fish man finds this suggestion reasonable, and begins to move in the direction of the desert. The lake becomes much smaller. We can see the old lake bed; it had grown significantly in size recently. He and the water Elementals head toward the desert.
