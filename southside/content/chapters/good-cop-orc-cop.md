[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) casts Suggestion on the last hostile Amber Guardsman. The command is “join us,” and he complies.

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) turns to Profeus, the wizard.

“Can you teleport us somewhere safe?” he asks.

“Yes! Join hands!” says Profeus.

Before we leave, Galadriel manages to grab four of the strange hexagonal stones from the cargo, and Hanamir chucks a vial of Alchemist’s Fire behind him, quickly engulfing the ship.

We teleport and find ourselves standing in an unfamiliar landscape. We’ve all grown up on the northern continent of Ivrend. Even the southern regions of Ivrend, including the area around Eillin, are temperate forests. But now we’re standing in a desert, a completely foreign biome to us. There is a wizard’s tower looming overhead. It seems in disrepair—if this belongs to Profeus, he’s been gone a long time. There are sand drifts blown up against the sides, and all we see is dunes and white sand in the distance for miles. 

The Amber Guardsmen under our Suggestion spells are startled by the change of scenery. AG 1 introduces himself as Mum Laughingcut, while AG 2 introduces himself as Fabed Dhada. 

“What are we doing here?” they ask. They’re upset about Jao Vedit being in the Bag of Holding, too. “He’ll die in there if you don’t let him out.”

“Don’t worry,” says Hanamir. “We’ve got this down to a science.” 

He pulls Jao Vedit out of the Bag of Holding and proceeds to “gently” knock him unconscious using pressure point techniques. He succeeds!

The Amber Guardsmen are alarmed by this—Vedit is still an ally to them.

“We think he’s under magical coercion, and we need to keep him safe,” says Hanamir. He turns to Profeus. “Anywhere you can think of to put him for now?”

“Well,” says Profeus in an adorable creaky old man voice. “I can’t think of a safer place than here. We have a cellar you can use.”

Hanamir brings Vedit down to the cellar and keeps him shackled, gagged, and unconscious. Seems OK.

Ushering us into a dusty living room, Profeus explains that this is indeed his old tower. 

“It’s been at least ten years since I’ve seen this place,” he says. “We’re pretty far away from things. At least a day’s walk to the nearest town.”

“Where are we?” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/).

“The Khinta Desert,” says Profeus. “This is an enormous desert that takes up most of the Khinta continent. Most people don’t travel to the interior for any reason. There are occasional people who pass through, but most people live on the Khinta coast. There’s a large city on the water.”

“Did you grow up here?” asks Galadriel.

He says he grew up near here, but it was very different then. He looks startled at the question, like it’s something he hasn’t thought about in a long time.

“How did you find yourself imprisoned by the AML?” asks [Harlan](/characters/harlan/).

“I was out on a walk,” he says. “I was gathering some materials for a spell. Long ago, before it was a desert, there were cities here, and you sometimes run into scavengers in the ruins. Well, I ran into some, and they captured me, and turned me into stone. Ever since then, they’ve only turned me back to my human form to be used for my spellcasting abilities. I complied because I didn’t know what else to do.”

“You were kept as a statue?” says Harlan.

“Yes. I was in a room with seven other statues. I never saw the others transformed to their original selves,” he says. “I assume I was in the city we came from.”

“Seems like your captors dealt a lot in stone,” says Tannin. “Do you know what these stones are for?” He takes the hexagonal stones from Galadriel and hands him one.

“These are… were… normal stones,” he says. “There’s nothing inherently magical about them. But for some reason, they’ve chosen these as vessels. There are mages that can imbue everyday objects with power. They’ve cast spells into these stones. To figure out which spells, I’d need to spend time with them, otherwise I’d risk casting the spell.”

Galadriel asks him which spells they usually forced him to cast into the stones.

“They wanted a spell that they could manipulate people’s fears with,” he says. “The one they made me do created illusions in people’s minds. It’s quite exhausting to cast. The illusions were meant to horrify them.” We sense some shame in his voice. “There are dozens of these stones, and each spell can affect many creatures. Occasionally they’d request something else. But typically they’d request this. There was another individual who would push the spell into the stone, while I cast it. But there were times it didn’t go well, and aspects of the spell would leak out. It affected my mind, the other mage’s mind… stone after stone… always the same stone. Always the same small purple oval.” 

So, the ones we have are not the ones he was using. They must contain a different spell.

“Do you know how to activate them?” asks [Cal](/characters/cal/).

“There’s an inherent knowledge, if you’re a spellcaster. Just hold it and want the spell to come out.”

“So this has been going on for ten years?!” says Tannin. “The Gehennans have been doing this that long?”

“I did see a Gehennan one time,” Profeus says. “There was one, particularly cruel, a fox man. It seemed like he felt he’d been crossed, and had a heated argument with two of my captors. He wound up slaying both of them. My captors looked like these two over here.” And he gestures to Mum and Fabed, who are hanging out on sofas nearby.

This is news to them. Mum speaks up.

“This old man maybe has been affected by the spells more than he thinks. They couldn’t have been holding him captive for ten years. Our understanding was that it was only a recent development that these AML people had planned their attack on the city.” 

Mum and Fabed struggle with cognitive dissonance. Jao Vedit had told them the AML were terrorists, and that they had to take out the ships. 

“Were you told we were responsible for the attacks?” says Cal.

“Aren’t you?” says Fabed.

“No!” we say in unison.

“Sir, we’d like to talk to the man in the cellar, but he is a spellcaster. Anything you can do to keep him from casting while we interrogate him?” says Hanamir, to Profeus.

“I can cast Counterspell,” says Profeus.

Hanamir takes Fabed and Mum to play some Fantasy Scrabble, while the rest of us go to the cellar to speak with Vedit. We wake him up. Harlan casts Zone of Truth while Galadriel and Profeus cast Counterspell.

“Hello, Vedit,” says Galadriel. “Tell us what you know of the AML.”

Harlan frowns, and indicates that Zone of Truth was unsuccessful on Vedit, so we’ll have to rely on our own intuition to determine his honesty.

“We’ve been tracking them,” says Vedit. “We’re aware there are unsavory things happening in the organization. But up until the attack on the Temple of Light, we didn’t have any direct evidence linking them to terrorism. We now have that evidence. We have infiltrated one of their cells and saw that they were transporting magical artifacts. On my order, my men were meant to seize both the warehouse and the the magical artifacts.” 

The Chillers exchange surprised and skeptical looks, but so far it does seem like Vedit is being truthful.

“Well, good news,” says Tannin. “Your mission was successful. That ship was stopped. Other good news: you have allies. We’re the best detectives Aberith has ever seen.” He flexes.

“Why am I here?” says Vedit. “Are you all members of the AML?”

“Just the opposite!” says Tannin. “We’re pretty sure they’re behind the attacks on the city and we’re trying to stop them. We stopped *you*… wrong place, wrong time, I guess. You were on the ship, and stopped us from doing the same thing you were trying to do.”

Hanamir gets the sense Vedit already knew we weren’t AML before Tannin responded.

“What’s your relationship with Ultas [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)?” asks Galadriel.

“He’s one of the Ministers,” says Vedit, looking confused, like their relationship is obvious. “A colleague. We’ve known each other a long time. He’s a difficult man, but I have no ill will towards him.”“You two are both Councilmembers, yes, but is there anything personal between you two?” asks Hanamir. “Did you know him before you took the job?”

“Of course. We had dealings when I was head of the Amber Guard as well,” says Vedit. “And he’s been a prominent figure in Aberith as long as I can remember. I’m not sure what you’re getting at.”

“Did Kandir lend you any money?” says Tannin, bluntly.

“Oh, well, yes…” says Vedit, a bit flustered. “Yes, at one point.” He’s visibly nervous. “I got involved in a bad business deal, and I happened to mention it in his presence, and he reached out and made a very generous offer to help get me out of that situation so that I could… well, this was right before I became the head of the Amber Guard. My financial prospects were looking good in the future, and he knew I’d be able to repay the loan. And he made sure I didn’t face any trouble in the meantime.”

“And what have you done in exchange for that favor?” asks Hanamir.

“I repaid the loan,” says Vedit.

“And?”

“If you’re implying I’ve done something unsavory, you’re wrong,” says Vedit. “We’re on the Council together, and we have similar interests. He asks things of me in that context, but he has not abused his power.” 

“What does he ask you to do?” says Hanamir.

“Occasionally he…” Vedit pauses. “Well, I can’t recall an example right now, but I’m sure it was fine.”

“Interesting that you can’t recall,” murmurs Hanamir. “Can you not recall a lot of things?”

“No, no, I can’t remember a specific case, but I’m sure it was all on the up and up. Just casual things. Someone dealing in illicit goods, perhaps… all business as usual.”

“Have you noticed more gaps in your memory since you’ve known Kandir?” asks Hanamir.

“I wouldn’t say gaps. It’s a busy job. There are sometimes specifics that I forget.”

Hanamir explains [Pouru](/characters/pouru/)’s situation before her death—her suspicion that her memories had been modified—and asks Vedit if that seems strange to him.

“Pouru was a traitor, and was executed for treason,” says Vedit, with disgust. “You believed her when she said her memory had been modified?”

“Yes,” says Hanamir. “And I believe your memory has been similarly modified, sir, and we would like to help fix that.”

Vedit recoils.

“How do I trust that *you* are not trying to modify my memory?”

“Well, if we wanted you dead, sir, you’d be dead. You’re alive because we’re not monstrous people, “ says Hanamir.

“But perhaps a member of the Council of Aberith would be valuable to you alive, with modified memories.”

Hanamir steps into the Zone of Truth and willingly fails the saving throw. 

“I swear to you, sir, I am telling the truth.” 

Vedit looks persuaded, relieved by this. 

“And what spell are you looking to cast on me?”

“Remove Curse,” says Hanamir. “A basic cleric spell.”

Harlan throws Hanamir a look at the word “basic,” but proceeds to cast Remove Curse. 

Vedit looks stunned. Words begin to tumble out of him.

“There have been a lot of favors. A lot. I don’t know the nature of them or why I would know them.” He sighs. “It does seem like you all are on to something. Perhaps Kandir is involved in some kind of smuggling. Mostly, I had to look the other way on things. He had to make sure certain people were not dealt with. Occasionally the Amber Guard would come across a plot, and he would intervene to make sure that the person responsible was freed. He told me to go to the boats and stop them and make sure that no members of the AML made it off the boats alive.”

“Do you remember any of the names of the people you were told to look the other way on?” asks Hanamir.

“Yes, several of them,” says Vedit. “Some of them are prominent people.” He gives us some names, but none of them are recognizable to us offhand.

“A moment ago, you mentioned you were ordered to go kill AML members. But shortly before that, you lied and said you thought we were members of the AML, when you knew we were not,” says Hanamir. “If you knew that, why did you try to arrest us?”

“I think things were still very hazy,” he says. “I didn’t think you all were members of the AML, but I also had this conflicting order in my head to make sure no AML got off that boat alive. Perhaps just that… nobody got off the boat alive.”

He’s still grappling with the realization of all that has happened here. It seems he’s understanding he was sent there to get rid of us.

Hanamir, staying in the Zone of Truth, gives Vedit some information about Kandir, including our suspicion that Kandir might be Number Six. As Kandir absorbs all this, he becomes angry. He feels violated. 

“We need to get back to Aberith immediately,” he says. “While I’m gone, Kandir’s hold on the Council is probably even stronger. If he’s doing things like this, he needs to be removed before he can cause more harm. Kandir also has…” he struggles with the memory. “He has something dangerous, and I’m not sure what it is. But I’m worried that if he knows he’s about to be uncovered, he might use it.”

“Can you get us a meeting with [Slee](/characters/slee/) on short notice?” says Hanamir.

“Yes,” says Vedit. “Kandir and I are the only two people who know where Slee has been hiding. We’ve kept him—he’s not on this plane. Kandir convinced Slee to—to leave the plane under threat of imminent attack. He’s being kept in a place Kandir arranged for. A member of the Amber Guard sleeps in Slee’s place at the castle so we could thwart any attack. That’s why he hasn’t been seen in awhile.”

“Can anyone other than Kandir access this place?”

“I don’t know. I can’t. I’m not sure how Kandir arranged for this. He has some sort of gate that he can open to access it. But Slee went there voluntarily, and I’ve seen him since then. But perhaps he can’t leave voluntarily, and doesn’t realize that.”

“When have you seen him?” asks Galadriel.

“He’s attended Council meetings. He’s been present. I could request an audience with him. Kandir might be aware of that, though.”

“How often are Council meeings?” asks Harlan.

“Weekly. Wednesdays at 3 pm.”

We try to convince Vedit not to just go in guns blazing against Kandir, which his anger compels him to want to do. Hanamir draws him a picture of a giant bug eyed Gehennan (which we suspect is Number Six/Kandir’s true form), and tries to underscore that this person probably has powers we don’t understand.
