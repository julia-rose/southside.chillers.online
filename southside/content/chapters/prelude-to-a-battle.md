[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) has no long game—having a price on his head is motivation enough to go after [Odo](/characters/odo/). There’s also the cachet of taking down a Beholder! So that’s something enticing.

If the will of the group is to go after Odo, we have 3 potential paths:

- Let ourselves get caught. The bounty prefers us alive—we could let Odo bring us in and proceed from there. This of course excludes [Cal](/characters/cal/) and [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), who could remain on the outside.

- Just show up. We know where Odo lives, we can just go right in. (Element of surprise! But lots of people there.)

- The half-orc boxing club spy network has gotten in with a group of 8-ish individuals, connected to Odo somehow, who follow a mini-boss named Dolhen. One member of that group, an orc, has been turned by the boxing club/dojo/monastery. This mini-boss reports directly to Odo. We could use that group as a middle ground between barging right in, and getting caught intentionally. The orc on the inside is named Durzol.

So, we have the potential to catch Odo offguard somewhere, outside his lair.  This is attractive to us.

Cal and Hanamir together roll an Investigation check. The info they get is: Odo doesn’t leave his compound pretty much ever, at least not above ground. The only way he travels at all is a system of tunnels beneath the city. We’re not clear how complex these tunnels are and how many places they go. The handful of times that Odo is said to appear in places other than his hideout… there’s no record of Odo ever using regular streets. There is a tunnel leading to the hideout of this half-orc crime boss, Dolhen. These tunnels would also lead into Odo’s hideout somehow.

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) makes a separate Investigation check to ask people around town about these tunnels. He learns that they were constructed originally by Odo’s predecessor, a person who ruled the crime scene before him (another Beholder, around for a long time before Odo seized control). [Kaz](/characters/kaz/)’s group also uses these tunnels. The system is elaborate, and not fully mapped even by Odo’s people. 

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) finds out: if Odo shows up somewhere, something is wrong. He does not leave his compound unless he is doling out a particular form of justice. He doesn’t go around collecting payments, etc. That is all handled by henchmen. He’s an incredibly paranoid individual who feels much safer at home. But he will go and deal with threats if he feels like he needs to send a strong message. He has 6 lieutenants, and we know one of them ([Oreheart](/characters/oreheart/)) was disintegrated. So there are 5 now. One lieutenant is Dolhen, the leader of the smaller half-orc crime group—he's an enforcer, a strong lieutenant, particularly cruel. If Dolhen fails, he might send Myn after them. Myn is a woman, but we’re not sure what race. Harlan is also aware of Fol, a goblin lieutenant.

Harlan learns that Odo does in fact sleep: Beholders sleep and dream of other Beholders, which brings them to life. It’s how they reproduce. Weird!!! So, sleep is a risky time to encounter one. Do they go to the bathroom? Yes—they eat, but rarely. They eat what they capture, if it's not useful to them as minions. Then they can go a long time without eating. So their excretory system is also limited to their dreams.

Galadriel asks [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) if he’d be willing to disguise himself as a manticore and particpate in Odo’s manticore fighting ring. Is this the best way to get him alone? There will be quite a crowd. He’ll be there, outside of his lair, but there’s an audience. 

Hanamir talks to Durzol about framing Dolhen. Durzol seems primarily motivated by money and hints that he’d need some in order to start fresh somewhere new. Hanamir offers him 100 gold as insurance. Durzol agrees, and tells Hanamir that Dolhen has been skimming off the total of the riches he’s supposed to passing along to Odo. Dolhen knows that Odo is always watching, and so keeps a small spy network of his own. He has three little creatures that work for him, strange one-eyed creatures. Odo doesn’t know about these creatures. Dolhen uses these creatures as his personal information-gathering systen. He doesn’t share the info they gather with Odo—or with anyone. Basically, he has plans in case the Council finally decides to crack down on Odo. So this is probably the thing that would enrage Odo the most: one of his lieutenants withholding information from him. 

Hanamir reassures Durzol he’ll be safe and thanks him. He then tells the group the plan: we cast Dream, and implant a dream in Odo's head wherein Dolhen’s one-eyed creatures are spying on him and gathering information and passing it along to Dolhen, who is in talks with [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)… just inception that doubt and paranoia in there. The one-eyed creatures are Nothics, apparently—keepers of forbidden knowledge and magical information. They have the ability to appear on someone and learn secrets about them.

Dream is one of Galadriel's new 5th level spells. [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) volunteers to be the “messenger” —he enters the dream in spider form and controls the content of the dream. Odo’s existing dream is visible to him. He’s currently dreaming of complete domination of Aberith. He’s king, no longer living in fear, everyone respects him, and he has little crowns on each of his eyes. It's a wonderful dream for him. Until… he starts seeing glimpses of the Nothics. He follows them and sees Dolhen handing over his secrets to the Council. In the dream, Odo points his petrification ray eye at Dolhen immediately, and Dolhen (not very dextrous) fails the save and is petrified. Odo then points the fear ray at him, torturing him. In order to get more info about how Odo fights, we bring in other lieutenants to the dream and simulate more betrayals.

Odo can shoot three eye rays at a time. All three were focused on Dolhen at first. [Kenoba](/characters/kenoba/), the drow lieutenant, casts Darkness, and Odo opens his central eye (usually closed in combat). The open central eye, it seems, can dispel magic within its field of vision. He points in whatever direction he doesn’t want magic to be cast. The Darkness is dispelled.

Then we have the goblin lieutenant, Fol, jump in and get close to him with a knife. As he does, a bunch of tentacle hands from the ground come up and grapple the goblin. He gets restrained, and then on Odo’s turn he uses his disintegration ray and makes quick work of him. 

A ranged weapon hit does actually get him. 

We end the dream with Dolhan surging in power and defeating Odo. The last thing we give him is the sense that “it’s not too late to prevent this” and an overhead shot of where Dolhan hangs out.
