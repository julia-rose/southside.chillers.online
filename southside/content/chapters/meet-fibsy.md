We discuss who takes the cube. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) un-attunes himself to his Pearl of Power and re-attunes to the cube. We take a long rest. 

After resting, Harlan rolls the cube. He now has a free cast of “Control Water” for today. 

Things are chaotic in Aberith. There is a lot of confusion and fear among the citizens. A lot of people have left the city—there’s a small exodus of people who are terrified of a third Sky Arrow attack. Quite a few Amber Guards have gone missing after having been revealed to be disloyal. 

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) tells [Slee](/characters/slee/) that the Blue Crescent society is at his disposal. He asks where to go if we want to look into [Kandir](/characters/kandir/). Slee suggests looking at his house first. 

The Blue Crescent society and the Temple of [Istus](/characters/istus/) help out with the relief effort. The Council doesn’t quite know what to make of Hanamir—this half-orc with a lot of power and an extensive network at his command? But despite their misgivings, they trust the Blue Crescent with a lot. They allocate 10,000 gold to the society. The Temple of Istus decides that Harlan is an excellent representative of the Temple, and puts its resources in his hands. Harlan collaborates with Hanamir to coordinate the relief effort. 

As that is happening in the background, the Chillers explore Kandir’s mansion. When we get there, we see that it hasn’t been prepared in any way. It doesn’t look like he was getting ready to leave. The bird is not here. [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) rolls investigation with advantage. Among Kandir’s items, we find documentation of his tampering with the Amber Guard. It doesn’t give us more information than we already suspected, but it does confirm that he intentionally bribed and blackmailed at least half a dozen Amber Guardsmen into obeying him. There’s a decent amount of wealth in this house—jewels, that fancy toilet, etc—totaling to about 1,500 gold. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) tries to rip the toilet out of the floor, but fails. The most interesting thing we find is a small brass key. It seems out of place. It doesn’t look like it goes to anything in the house. It has a small symbol on it that catches Chunk’s eye. It reminds us of the writing from the Message scroll, though it doesn’t match any of the characters. 

The house, overall, doesn’t look like a spellcaster lived there, which is interesting to us. It seems like his wizarding headquarters may be elsewhere. 

Hanamir decides to brute-force rip the house apart to see if there’s anything secret hidden in the walls, behind shelves, etc. Almost too quickly, [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) joins in. They find a wall safe. Inside it, they find—neatly pressed, and seemingly unworn—robes. Multicolored robes. Next to it is a small notebook with several names. [Bracket](/characters/bracket/) the Gnome is listed in it, as is [Hermione](/characters/hermione/), as is one of [Odo](/characters/odo/)’s deputies. (Chastity the never-played baker is in there, too.) This is a list of contacts with notes about what they’re useful for, especially if that involves finding things. Kandir was attempting to find powerful artifacts. Two names that are bolded and underlined: Transa (located in Peloria, which is a town on the same continent, not far from Aberith), and Fibsy (with an address in Outer Aberith we could find, just north of the city wall). Galadriel takes the three clown robes for future use. None of them are color patterns we’ve seen before (green and yellow, yellow and red, purple and pink). 

Kandir’s house is starting to feel less structurally sound. We head out to go find Fibsy, heading toward the northern outskirts of Aberith. Harlan and Galadriel take on their usual disguises, pretending to be Inspectors Blunderbuss and von Hastings, here to determine changes in the law against magical artifacts. They knock on the door and are greeted by an individual with snake-like features. 

We talk to Fibsy, whose full name is Fibonacci Sequins. He sees through our disguises, and we introduce ourselves for real and bring in the rest of the crew. Tannin shakes Fibsy’s hand warmly and starts cooking some rabbits over a fire. 

We make smalltalk. He is from the City of Sigil, where he studied artificery. He agrees to help us find the holy artifacts of each school of magic (the group of objects to which the Sky Arrow, the Quiznos, the Three-Sided Coin, and the Cube all belong).
