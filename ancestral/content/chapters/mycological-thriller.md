Gunnloda and Beifir now stand in the center of what seems to be a man-made cave in the face of the cliff. Valmus and Saul wait back on the path, having been unwilling to disregard the cautionary sign for the sake of curiosity.

“Are you sure we should be in here?” asks Beifir. He inspects the long lines of copper that twist along the interior cave walls. They fan out from a curious little device in the center of the cave. Gunnloda has put on her magnifying eyeglasses and squats next to the machine, which emits steady ticking noises. “The sign did say ‘danger.’”

“I have been delving sites like this since before you were born, elf boy,” says Gunnloda. There is a note of defensiveness in her voice as she takes out a set of odd little tongs and uses them to measure the length and width of the device.

“That’s probably not chronologically true,” says Beifir, but he lets it go. He runs a hand over the grooved stone walls. Although he’s an explorer at heart, he’s a little unnerved by the density and darkness of it all. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”

“Neither have I,” says Gunnloda. She stuffs the tongs back into her toolkit. “This is clearly a timekeeper of some kind, but why is it here? What is it measuring?”

“Do you at least know why the copper filaments are poking into these pockets in the walls?” says Beifir. He nudges her until she begrudgingly looks up from the device and points to some narrow gaps in the rock.

“Oh!” says Gunnloda. She stifles the alarm in her voice. “We should go, I think. Yeah, we should probably leave.”

“Wait, what does it mean?”

“Well, I still don’t know about the device—” she mutters, pushing him ahead of her toward the cave opening, “but the placement of those pockets—given the structure of the slate—it’s exactly where you’d make a seam, and—this must be some newfangled—ridiculous—” 

“I get it! You can stop shoving me!” says Beifir. He sprints ahead on much longer legs and calls back to her apologetically. “I promised my mom I’d die outside!”

Behind her, Gunnloda hears a heavy click that sounds, to her displeasure, quite final. She has not cleared the opening of the cave when she feels the blast launch her forward, enveloping her in heat so intense she feels the skin on the back of her neck searing like a steak.

In the next confusing moment, a heavy object hurtles toward her from the side and knocks her to the ground. Gunnloda guesses she must have been hit by debris from the explosion and will soon be pinned beneath it—she starts planning for the end—if she’s not immediately crushed to death, she’ll have to find a way to do it herself, to cut the suffering short—

But instead of flattening her, the shape behaves more like armor. She feels it begin to move, in fact, once the moment passes. Its surface is like scale mail, or maybe just… scales… 

“Close one,” says a familiar voice. 

Gunnloda opens her eyes and sees the honestly terrifying face of the Company’s sergeant.

“Surina!” she says with a laugh.

Surina sports a plated crimson exoskeleton, predatory yellow eyes, and an impressive set of jaws. Maybe it’s this visual impact that causes crowds to fall silent in her presence. It’s difficult not to stare.

“What do I always say about taking unnecessary risks?” says Surina. She pulls Gunnloda up by her wrist. “I expect that kind of thing from Beifir, but you, Gunnloda?! I’m surprised.”

“I know,” says Gunnloda. “There was a device I didn’t understand, and…”

“That explains it,” says Surina. “Glad you’re all right.”

“Thank you,” says Gunnloda, looking sheepish.

They rejoin the others back on the path through the rocks. Beifir combs the mane of an imposing black war horse—Surina’s steed, appropriately named Epic.

“Beifir,” says Surina, nodding toward him. “Valmus. Saul. It’s good to see all of you.”

“Well met, Surina,” says Saul with a bow.

“Little one’s looking worse for wear,” notes Valmus. “What was that all about? We heard something loud.”

“Don’t call me that,” says Gunnloda. “It was some southern foolishness. A crude mockery of the art of mining. I suppose those without the requisite skill *would* take shortcuts.”

“So it was technology you’d never seen before, is that right?” Valmus smirks.

Gunnloda flushes, but has no retort ready.

“Let’s go,” says Surina, waving a hefty arm. “I’ve been traveling at pace-and-a-half to reach you. Now I’m accustomed to it. You all had better keep up.”

Back home, Beifir is well known for his skill at foraging. The plants native to the western forests can be dangerous, so a trained eye for look-alikes and varietals is key. Before leaving on his *hyppää-ympäriinsä*, he hosted a dinner party with six courses of foraged delicacies for his friends, to great fanfare. He thinks he might make a happy life in the culinary arts—that is, if he survives his current dabbling in the mercenary business.

In the late afternoon, at a comfortable distance ahead of his colleagues, the scout spots a cloud of truffle flies hovering over the roots of a hazel tree. He stops on the path and looks around as if checking for witnesses. The rest of the officers won’t notice if he takes a minute, just a minute, to investigate. If there are truffles under there, they’ll all be thanking him anyway. He’s not a monster. He’d share.

He kneels down at the base of the tree and scoops up handfuls of fresh earth. These roots are supple and strong, he notes—the perfect environment for truffles to form. He feels almost giddy with anticipation. About a foot into the soil, he touches the surface of a white truffle, lumpy and cool. And there’s not just one! There’s a small cluster of perfect truffles under there! 

He stows them safely in his satchel, unable to suppress his grin. The scent of them is nigh intoxicating. It masks the other scent he’d been picking up, a much less pleasant one reminiscent of rot… which, come to think of it, is quite strong down here on the ground. He sighs, not wanting to mar this moment of exquisite luck with something gross, but knowing it’s his duty to figure out what’s going on in the woods.

After only a few steps off the path, the odor is unmistakable: there are dead things nearby. His breath catches in his throat when he sees them. The bodies of a drow man, woman, and child are laid out in a row, their unblinking faces staring at the canopy above. Beifir turns on his heel and goes to inform the others.

“Bodies? Drow?” says Surina, when he reaches them. “Unfortunate news. Please lead the way.”

“We should mention, Surina—we saw a drow mother and her child fleeing a group of highwaymen earlier,” says Valmus. “I’d guess the drow are aware of the impending threat and many have decided to take to the road, where bandits are taking advantage of the situation.”

“We took care of the highwaymen, of course,” adds Saul.

They approach the patch of forest where Beifir discovered the bodies. He points at the hazel tree with pride.

“I found some truffles down there,” he says. “That’s actually how I noticed the bodies. I’m not sure I would have otherwise.”

Gunnloda stands over the dead drow family with her hands clasped behind her back.

“Deep lacerations on all three,” she says. “Certainly these were violent deaths with bladed weapons.”

Saul crouches by the drow man, digging through his pockets.

“Interesting,” he murmurs. “They were not killed for their valuables. Still a fair bit of gold on this one.” 

“No sigils, no parchment, no identifiers at all,” says Valmus, who has begun rifling through the woman’s shoulder bag. 

“I don’t get it,” says Beifir. “Why murder an entire family on the road for no reason? Even the ruffians we fought earlier had greed as a motive.”

“Can we use our surroundings for context?” asks Surina, almost rhetorically. “Might there have been witnesses in the vicinity?”

“I suppose I could ask the plants,” says Beifir. 

Gunnloda scoffs and mutters something about touchy-feely elvish nonsense, but Surina nods encouragingly.

“Yes, I think that would be very helpful,” she says. 

Beifir sits down on a tuft of dead leaves. 

“I think I’ll try and chat with these mushrooms here,” he says, indicating a clutch of small, red-capped mushrooms near the bodies. “I feel I owe it to them after harvesting their truffle brethren earlier. You know, say thanks and all.”

He closes his eyes and searches in his mind for the mushrooms in the chorus of vibratory noise that resonates from every inch of the forest. As it turns out, these toadstools are loud, and are vibrating at a frequency of pure rage.

“!!!!!!!!” says one of them.

“I wanted to ask you if you knew anything about what happened to these people here,” says Beifir.

“SiT oN a PiNeCOnE aNd EaT mY sPoReS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” says the mushroom.

“Hmm,” says Beifir. “I don’t think these mushrooms want to talk to me.”

“Maybe try one of the trees,” suggests Surina.

A nearby oak does prove to be more amenable to discussion. 

“Thæy wëre nøt kîlled hëre~¿~” says the tree. “Thèy wêre draggèd tœ thïs plåce, alreådy déad~~~”

“Who brought them here?” asks Beifir.

“Çréatüres, lîke yöürsëlf~~~” says the tree, “büt with bãrk thát wás grëën~”

“Orcs, I bet,” says Beifir. “How many?”

“Møre thån nøne?¿¿¿~ bÜt fêwêr thãñ à förést~~⁄⁄⁄⁄⁄~~!~”

“That’s a bit of a range,” says Beifir. “Can you be any more specific?”

“Nø????¿¿¿”

“Okay, well, thank you,” says Beifir. 

“( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)~~~~~~” says the tree, returning to silence.

Beifir summarizes the tree’s report for the others. 

“Orcs killed them elsewhere and dragged them here, but no idea why, or how many there were. I don’t think trees are great with numbers,” he says.

“That’s all right,” says Surina. “Let’s move on. Hopefully, we can prevent more such tragedies from taking place.”

Beifir frowns down at the red-capped mushrooms. Rude as they were, they still might be delicious if prepared correctly. He plucks them from the ground and adds them to his stash of truffles. What better time to experiment with foreign flavors than during one’s *hyppää-ympäriinsä*, after all?

---

The night, when it falls, is dark. The forest blocks out any starlight that might have shone through the clouds. The officers of the Silver Chain Company set up camp in a mossy clearing between two shallow streams. 

Surina finds a soft spot for Epic the horse to rest and covers him with a heavy blanket. Beifir makes a bit of a show out of how comfortable he finds the natural moss as a resting surface, while Valmus, who is partial to glamping, sets up his bedroll while wearing silk pajamas and a sleep mask with a 😈 face on it strapped to his forehead.

“Whoa,” says Beifir, as he sets down his satchel for the night. “The red mushrooms from before—they’re almost double the size they used to be!”

He casts Detect Magic. A foul aura of necromancy surrounds the red caps.

“Hey, Saul?” he calls over. The older man always sets up his bedroll at a distance from the rest of the group. Beifir chalks it up to his general orneriness, but it’s a little weird. “What do you know about necromancy?”

Saul freezes in place.

“Why?”

“These mushrooms I gathered earlier are suffused with it, and they’re expanding,” says Beifir.

“In the course of a cleric’s life, one tends to learn some things about darker paths. But to be clear,” says Saul, “Pelor does not look kindly upon that practice.”

“Dispense with the theatrics, and tell us what you know,” says Gunnloda.

“If you had seen the things I have seen in my time, you would not speak so flippantly of the unholy forces that—”

“Please,” says Gunnloda. “Make a religion check or go to sleep.”

Saul glowers at her, but proceeds to observe the visibly growing mushrooms. 

“Hmm,” he concludes. “I… I don’t…”

“Some cleric,” snorts Gunnloda.

“Maybe I can try speaking with them again,” says Beifir. He closes his eyes and concentrates. 

“hAhHahAHAhahA LoSeR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” says the chattiest mushroom.

“Here, I’ll cast Suggestion on it,” says Saul, apparently as a peace offering. He raises a hand over the mushroom. "*Cooperate with this hippie.*"

The mushroom shrieks until the power of the Suggestion is too strong for it to resist.

“What are you? And why wouldn’t you speak to me before?” asks Beifir.

“I wAs AnGrY!!!! I’m StiLL aNgRy!!!!!” says the mushroom.

“Why so angry?” asks Saul.

“wHy dO yOU brEaThe Air?” says the mushroom. “I aM aN AnGrY GUY!!!!”

“What are you, though?” says Valmus, peeking up from his plush sleep setup.

Beifir starts to laugh. 

“I’m getting the mental image of this little angry gnome man,” he says, “wearing this stupid red hat and making a really mean face.”

“iT’s NOT STUPID!!!!!”

“So you’re one of those guys? You’ll grow into that?” he asks.

“i’M VERY yOunG! ThEse tHinGs tAkE tiMe!!!!”

“When were you born?” asks Surina.

“TwO dAyS AGO!!!!”

“And do you remember anything about the people who were killed and left near you?”

“iT wAs a ConFUsiNG TiME foR mE!!!!!!!!!!”

“Let’s see if it’ll give us more helpful information with some encouragement.” Gunnloda pulls a set of clamps from her toolkit and mimes squeezing the life out of a small object with them. The mushroom nods approvingly.

“ThiS oNe GeTs iT!!!” it screeches. “GooD mUrDeRinG! YeS!!!”

“So you’re a fan of murder, then?” asks Beifir.

“YoU cOULd sAy it’S mY LiFe’s pUrPoSe!!!!!!!!”

“All right, then,” says Beifir. “Guys, I know this might seem crazy, but I think we should keep these shrooms around, if only so that we can use their murderous impulses against the orcs later.”

“Fine by me,” says Gunnloda. “I’m going to bed.”

“I encourage all of you to do so,” says Surina. “We’re getting up at dawn and keeping our pace brisk tomorrow. Rest up.”

Beifir stuffs the mushrooms back in the satchel and hopes they don’t outgrow it overnight.

Now that they are only thirty miles out from Eillin, the road is noticeably smoother and better-maintained, and the signs of humanoid settlements begin to appear. Fields of grain fenced by wooden posts and sprawling gourd farms line their path as the forest gives way to cultivated land. 

The early morning air is crisp and cool. The overcast sky and chilly temperatures are welcome to the travelers, who work up a sweat before the day has truly broken. Their journey is silent until Beifir flags a cabin up ahead, the light of a fireplace dancing against its windows in the pre-dawn.

“Permission to approach?” he asks.

“Granted,” says Surina.

Beifir sneaks up close to the cabin and crouches beneath a window. After a few moments, he waves the others to join him, and puts a finger to his lips. Inside the cabin, a male and female voice are arguing. 

“The Builders will protect us,” says the woman. “We should go to the tower. There’s no time left to waste.”

“I’d rather go to town, to the Weavers,” says the man. “Come on. You know it’s the safer bet.”

Surina’s eyes widen.

“Now’s our chance to protect those seeking refuge,” she whispers. “I’d knock on their door myself, but I don’t want to scare them to death.”

“Oh, don’t worry, I’ll do it,” whispers Valmus, deadpan. Surina elbows him in the ribs.

“I’ll do it,” says Saul.

“Me too,” says Beifir. 

Gunnloda shrugs.

The argument between the cabin-dwellers ends abruptly when Saul raps on the door. It creaks open not more than an inch, and he can see a sliver of a drow man’s face inside.

“What do you want?” says the man.

“Good morning,” says Saul. “We are the officers of the Silver Chain Company, sent here to defend Eillin and its surroundings from an orcish invasion. I’m sure you’ve heard.” He bows. “I am Saul Kegan, cleric of Pelor. I’d like to offer you safe passage to the town of Eillin as we journey there ourselves.”

The man opens the door wider and seems to relax.

“It’s good to meet you,” he says. “I’m Minolas Herelon, and this is my wife, Vizema.” The woman behind him waves. “We thank you for your kind offer, but we’re quite all right. No need for an escort to town. We’ve made plans of our own.”

“Well, the thing is,” starts Beifir, without introduction, “we came across some other folks on the road yesterday who met a terrible fate, and we’d hate for that to happen to you, too.”

Minolas wraps an arm around Vizema.

“My good sir, is that a threat?”

Surina calls to them from a safe distance away. The drow couple startles nonetheless when they glimpse her. 

“Please excuse my friends!” says Surina. “We truly mean you no harm. We did encounter a terrible tragedy yesterday, and we desire only to provide help to you, if you wish it.” She pauses. “The victims were, uh—folks like yourselves.”

“We call ourselves the Good Elves, ma’am,” says Vizema, with a side-eye at Beifir. “And we thank you, but my husband and I will be on our way soon enough, on our own.”

“Where will you go?” asks Saul.

“Ah… well, where are any of us truly going?” says Minolas vaguely. 

“Where indeed,” says Beifir. He decides to take a risk. “Well, we’ll be on our way. If you need to send word to us, you can leave a message in town with the Weavers.”

“Aha!” says Minolas. “You know of the Weavers? How is Charles doing?”

“I’m afraid I don’t know him by name,” sputters Beifir, “but I know—um, my experience with the Weavers is… I know you can leave a message with them, and it’d find its way to us.”

“Very well,” says Minolas. “If you see Baromar, tell him thank you for the truffles, and we’ll see him soon.”

“Oh!” says Beifir, newly engaged. He opens his satchel and procures a truffle. “I found some truffles a short way back along the road.” 

“Yes, they are wonderful this time of year. Very impressive harvest!” says Minolas.

“I also found a different variety that I’m not familiar with. Would you help me identify it?” Beifir asks. Vizema and Minolas look at each other and nod noncomittally.

He holds up one of the red caps. The expressions on Minolas and Vizema’s faces turn to shocked offense. Minolas recoils and slams the door shut in Beifir’s face.

“Wait!” says Beifir to the door. “Are they bad?”

Saul raises his eyebrows. 

“You should probably get rid of those,” he says. The mushroom in Beifir’s hand now looks like a little gingerbread man with stubby, half-formed limbs.

“Maybe you’re right,” Beifir sighs. “I just wanted to get creative with them. As food or as a weapon.”

“We must try to minimize unnecessary risk,” says Surina. “Gunnloda learned that yesterday. Right, Gunnloda?”

Gunnloda grumbles something unintelligible. 

The officers continue onward under the cloud-muted light of the rising sun.
