The rest of the gloomy day is exciting only for Beifir, who identifies a grove of black cherry trees in the mid-afternoon and gathers a bulging sack full of berries before Surina tells him to stop. 

“I’m going to need to find some more bags when we get to Eillin,” he says. “I’m running out of receptacles to store all my foraged treasures!” 

“Son, how do you know you’re not stealing those from a cherry farmer?” asks Gunnloda.

“I don’t.” Beifir shrugs, tossing a cherry into the air and catching it in his mouth. He chews, flashes her a dark red grin, and spits the pit onto the ground.

“We’ve passed a shocking number of gourd farms today,” says Valmus. “You could try stealing a pumpkin. You know, raise the stakes a little.”

“Only if you carry it for me,” says Beifir. “The red caps are almost too big for my satchel now, and these cherries are heavy.” He eats another one and makes excessive noises of enjoyment, moaning rapturously. “It’s because they’re *so* juicy.”

“That’s enough,” says Surina. “We’re here to protect these people, not steal from them. No filching of pumpkins allowed.”

“Hmph,” says Beifir. “Hey Saul, what does Pelor say about who ‘owns’ food when it’s growing out of the ground?”

Saul, who walks behind the rest of them by a few meters, looks on with what might be amusement or annoyance.

“There is a story about a king whose greed could never be satisfied,” says Saul. “Despite his wealth, he stole gold from the temple’s donation box—gold that would have gone to feed the poor orphans of his kingdom. Pelor saw this and turned the king into grain, and instructed the priests of the temple to bake bread for the orphans with it.”

“Um,” says Beifir. “I don’t think that really applies to this situation.”

“Does it not?” Saul shrugs. “I wasn’t really listening. But that’s what Pelor has to say about theft.”

The road winds back into progressively denser wooded areas, however, so the discussion of pumpkin theft becomes moot. By nightfall, the officers of the Silver Chain Company are again trudging through a forest. The forest is primarily populated by tall, thin trees with bark like peeling white paper. 

“I’m getting bad vibes from something,” Beifir reports. “Something feels… creepy.”

“Is it the murderous mushrooms you’re still carrying around with you?” asks Saul. 

“Maybe,” says Beifir. “But it feels creepy like… actual creeping. Something with many legs. Something hiding in the shadows.”

Beifir holds up a hand, and the officers all stop in their tracks. He moves in silence toward a clearing ahead, then waves them to follow.

The black earth has been swept of leaves and is marked by chalk lines forming an elaborate symbol. In the center of the shape rests a leather-bound journal, a bag of chalk, an astrolabe, and what looks like a small cosmetics case.

“Whaaaaaaaat,” murmurs Valmus, torn between a giggle and a gasp. “Did we just discover a forest cult ritual in progress?” 

“I’m not going to stick around and find out,” says Beifir, backing away. “I’m going to go find a good spot to start a fire and get rid of the red caps.”

“Seriously? This seriously gives you the creeps?” says Valmus. He walks forward into the clearing to take a closer look at the symbol drawn in chalk. “This looks fake.” He peers at the cosmetics case. “And what’s this? Eye makeup? Someone left their diary and smoky eye out here.”

“I’ll go with Beifir,” says Saul. “I’d like to see how these mushrooms respond to fire.”

“No!” says Gunnloda. “No, we really shouldn’t split the party.” She looks uncharacteristically troubled. “We only just got Surina back. Let’s not go in different directions now.”

“I think it’s all right, Gunnloda,” says Surina. “They won’t be going far. They’ll dispose of the red caps and then come back, right, guys?”

“I’ll come back, but I’m not touching that clearing,” says Beifir.

“Guys!” hisses Gunnloda, but the two of them are already disappearing into the thicket. 

“For real, they’ll be fine,” says Valmus. “Come look at this journal.” He laughs and holds it open for her. “I think a kid did this! It’s full of drawings of spiders.” 

“You know, I do think Beifir’s right that there’s an unusual power to this place,” says Surina. She breathes in slowly and deeply. “There’s a choking sort of density to the air. Something heavy. It’s dampening all the sounds.” She snaps her fingers, and the sound is dull and muted. “Hear what I mean?”

“I don’t like forests,” Gunnloda mumbles. “And I don’t like it when people leave.” She clears her throat. “During a mission, I mean. We have a mission. We need all of us to complete it.”

“I know, sweetie,” says Surina, prompting Gunnloda to kick a tree at the indignity of being called ‘sweetie’. “Come here and look at this thing! I think it’s for measuring the stars. You don’t have one of these, right?” She turns it over. “It says ‘Helviund’ on it. Is it called a helviund?”

“It’s called an astrolabe, and it’s for navigation,” says Gunnloda. “And no, I don’t have one.”

“If anyone can figure out how it works, it’ll be you,” says Surina. She holds it up, and Gunnloda stomps over to take it. 

“Oh, man, wait ‘til Beifir gets back,” says Valmus. “I think there’s poetry in here, too, but it’s in Elvish. Either of you read Elvish?”

“It’s been on my to-learn list forever,” says Surina. “But no.”

A half hour of Gunnloda sulkily inspecting the astrolabe later, Saul and Beifir return. 

“You guys should have seen it,” Beifir reports, wide-eyed. “It was disgusting.”

“And definitely the correct move,” says Saul.

“The mushrooms basically melted into pools of blood,” says Beifir. “I still wish Minolas had told us what they were, though.”

“The *mushrooms* already told us what they were,” says Saul. “Little gnomes who love murder.”

“Still.”

“Hey, Beifir, come translate this poetry,” says Valmus. “Given the illustrations, I’m going to bet it’s all about spiders.”

“That would be appropriate, since there’s a huge spider’s nest up that tree you’re leaning on,” says Beifir. 

Valmus jumps away. 

“Are we ready to move on?” says Surina.

“Yes, please,” says Beifir.

“Fine,” says Gunnloda. 

They walk through the dark forest for another hour until the scent of birch smoke fills their nostrils. 

“Probably a campfire,” says Beifir. “Could be more refugees.”

“Could be bandits,” says Gunnloda.

“We won’t know unless we approach,” says Surina. “All in favor?” 

No one says anything. Gunnloda’s crankiness has spread to Valmus, whose daily tolerance for walking has just about reached its limit.

“Can we find a spot to make a campfire ourselves soon?” he suggests.

“Really? No one wants to see what’s going on?” says Surina.

“Nah,” says Saul. 

“All right, then,” says Surina. “Overruled.”

They continue their march. As they pass the soft glow of the campfire in the distant woods to their right, Beifir gasps.

“I think I saw another blue cone!” he murmurs, glancing at Saul. “Somewhere out there by the fire. But then it disappeared.”

“Wasn’t me this time,” says Saul.

The trees finally begin to grow sparser, indicating that the forest may yield to more farmland soon. The moon is once again visible between the branches. Tonight it hangs in the sky like a silver sickle, thin and sharp. A smoky cloud drifts over it and dims its soft light. When the cloud passes, the moon is blood red.

“Check out the moon,” says Valmus. “Moon druid, is that normal?”

“No,” says Beifir. 

The sound of leaves crunching beneath soft-shoed feet from all around interrupts them. 

“Orcs!” cries Surina.

Four unusually slender orcs in hoods and masks have descended around them at four corners. They leap past the quick-drawn weapons of Surina, Gunnloda, Beifir, and Valmus and attack Saul in unison. 

“Wait, why him?!” cries Beifir. 

The other four officers scramble to counterattack as the terrible sound of scimitars cutting through flesh can be heard between Saul’s screams. Valmus readies a Ray of Frost and is the first to make contact with the attackers. The closest orc freezes in place, leaving himself wide open for two devastating blows from Gunnloda’s greatsword.

A guttural roar signifies Beifir’s transformation into a bear. He grabs a second orc by the back of the hood and sinks his teeth into gray-green flesh, severing an artery, then roaring again as his prey twists around and stabs him in the gut with a scimitar.

Valmus has another spell prepared, a Fireball this time, and he launches it at the wounded orc whom he’d previously frozen. It expires in a cloud of steam. Gunnloda swings her sword at the orc who stabbed Beifir and impales him. The ensuing spurt of blood that hits her in the face is hot and sticky but not unsatisfying. She kicks the body off of her blade and turns toward a third orc who is still slicing at Saul without paying attention to anyone else. The third orc moves to take a swing at Valmus.

“Stand back, I’m doing Hellish Rebuke on this one,” says Valmus. “Never done it before. Kind of afraid I might die.”

“We all might die!” roars Gunnloda. 

“Cool, thanks!” says Valmus. When the orc’s scimitar hits him in the chest, an opposing force of white-hot flame bounces back at the assailant. The orc twists and flails in the hellfire before collapsing to the ground, dead. Beifir stomps on it for good measure.

Surina, who has busied herself trying to stabilize Saul, raises her head and shouts to the last remaining orc.

“You!” her voice booms. “Are you ready to surrender?”

The orc says nothing. He lifts his scimitar and breaks into a run toward Valmus.

“Guess not,” says Valmus. But instead of casting another fatal spell, he summons his last reserves of energy and raises a hand to the orc. An uncanny red glow appears around his palm, and the orc shrinks mid-swing into a tiny object on the ground. Valmus sways and nearly stumbles, but Gunnloda props him up.

“What is that?” she asks. In the darkness, the small shape before them is barely visible.

“It’s a… frog…” says Valmus, his breathing labored. “I wanted to give us… some time… to question him…”

Beifir returns to his elf body and lets Valmus lean some weight against him. 

“It’s a frog?” he asks. “It kind of looks like an avocado. A really *sad* avocado.”

“I thought…” wheezes Valmus, “it would be funny…”

“It is funny, bud,” says Beifir, patting him on the back. “You did good.”

“It’ll last… an hour…” 

“That’s perfect, Valmus,” says Gunnloda. She lets Beifir lead Valmus over to a tree stump to have a seat, and approaches Surina and Saul. “How is he?”

“Not good,” says Surina. Her hands are covered in blood. “But I think we can bring him back. Can you grab my potion bandolier, please?”

Gunnloda obeys. Surina picks a small vial of dark liquid and pours it into Saul’s mouth, pinching his nostrils shut. 

“That should do it,” she says.

Indeed, a moment later, Saul is coughing and spluttering. He sits up, his eyes wild with rage.

“Hey… hey Saul! Look… look at that frog…” says Valmus, pointing toward the creature with obvious pride.  

“What is it?” says Saul. A residual mouthful of blood escapes through his teeth and down his chin. It does not help to temper his unhinged expression.

“I polymorphed… the last orc…” says Valmus.

“We were going to question it, but it’s up to you,” says Surina. “After what they just did to you, it’s all yours.”

Saul crawls toward the frog and grabs it roughly. He holds it up in one arm and grits his bloody teeth. 

“You okay, man?” says Beifir. 

Saul’s eyes have gone black. He seems to absorb the frog’s life force—there is a visible illumination seeping out from the frog’s bumpy skin into his hand, traveling through the veins of his wrist. 

“It’ll turn back into an orc if you keep doing that,” warns Gunnloda.

Saul stops short just as the frog’s polymorphed form begins to flicker, but his eyes remain shining black marbles. The other officers are dumbstruck.

“I guess… they’re teaching… some new stuff… at the temple of Pelor these days,” croaks Valmus, in an apparent attempt to lighten the mood. 

But this only serves to highlight the uncomfortable truth of the moment. If Saul even really is a cleric of Pelor, he is also something else. Something different. Something dark.

“I’m going to check the other bodies for identifiers,” says Surina quietly.

“Not yet,” says Saul. “I’m not done.”

He drops the avocado frog on the ground and summons a ring of unbearably bright fire around it, making the others shield their eyes. He stares directly at the frog through the flames. It stares back, unblinking as it transforms back into an orc, unscreaming as the radiant fire reduces its body to ashes.

Above them, the red moon turns back to white. Saul’s eyes begin to clear. He looks energized and healthy, certainly nowhere near death’s door. He smiles at the smoldering remains of the orc before him. No one speaks, busying themselves sorting through the belongings of the other three orcs.

“They all carry the same pendant,” says Surina, after a long silence. “It’s a skull with a crescent moon through its mouth.”

“I don’t know the orc pantheon well enough,” says Beifir, “but I think that’s the symbol of Shargaas?”

“I think you’re right,” says Gunnloda.

They walk a token distance away from the site of the brutal encounter before setting up camp for the night. 

As is his custom, Saul sets up his bedroll at a distance away from everyone else. But tonight, the move feels less like a personal preference and more like a sign of the pathological, something they all should have picked up on before.

Beifir is the first to whisper to the others.

“So, are we going to talk about how weird that was back there?” he says.

“Yes,” Valmus and Gunnloda say in unison.

“I think we’ll need to, at some point,” says Surina. “I will find a moment to talk to him about it alone tomorrow. As a fellow devotee of Pelor, I would hope he’d feel comfortable discussing religious matters with me.”

“But…” says Beifir. “That didn’t look like Pelor stuff. I know I’m the newest officer of the Company, and there’s history here I don’t know about, but are we sure he’s really who he says he is?”

“Yes,” says Surina, with a confidence that surprises Beifir. “You know about the battle that made him famous, right?”

“Kind of,” says Beifir. “I don’t know all the details.”

“Well, other than those who witnessed it, few people do,” says Surina. “And Saul doesn’t like to talk about it. I think he’s uncomfortable with all the praise. But—and I mean this seriously—Saul is responsible for saving the lives of a major proportion of Aberith’s armed forces.”

“Because of a prayer, right?” says Beifir. “Okay, and I’m sorry if this is rude, but how does everyone know it was the prayer that saved everyone?”

“It was… dramatic,” says Surina. She thinks for a moment. “He put himself directly between the hobgoblin forces and Aberith’s front line. It’s really hard to explain unless you were there, but suffice it to say, everyone who was there trusts him implicitly. They all owe him their lives. You can see it in their faces. They *adore* him.”

“I’m just going to say… I have seen… some stuff,” says Valmus, whose lungs still quake with exhaustion. “And that business with the frog… reminded me of Aberith’s underworld… not of any god of Light.”

“It was indeed strange,” agrees Gunnloda. “But Saul has been nothing but loyal to the Company and the mission. His religious alignment is none of our business, as far as I’m concerned, as long as he never threatens any of us or the work we are duty-bound to do.”

“Yeah,” yawns Beifir. “I guess if he just keeps roasting orcs…and sucking out their life force...” 

“We’ll discuss it more in the morning,” says Surina. “Get some sleep.”

Alone in his bedroll, far out of earshot, Saul is already snoring. He sleeps better that night than he has in decades.
