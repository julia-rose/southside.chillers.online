Beifir and Saul stand back to back on the battlefield. They are gravely outnumbered. To Saul’s left, he sees an orc fatally stab a Silver Chain soldier through the neck with a scimitar.

“Roar once if you can see Zahgorim,” says Saul. “Roar twice if you can’t.”

Beifir, currently a bear, bellows a single great roar and shreds an orc infantryman to ribbons with his claws. 

“Good,” says Saul. “We take her out at all costs—” He swings his axe, embedding it in an orc’s back. “—as quickly as we can—” He spins around and hits another orc, right in the face. “—otherwise, we’ll be overrun very, very soon—”

They work together this way, inching ever closer to Zahgorim, until the distant dragon’s breath lights up the sky.


"*Another* one?” Saul shouts over the clash of weapons. The brief interruption takes the orcs by surprise, giving him a chance to survey his surroundings. Zahgorim is only a few feet away.

Above them both, Gunnloda in copper dragon form takes a swipe at Zahgorim with a clawed foot, but the orc general dodges out of the way. Still, it upsets her balance, and leaves an opening for Beifir to pounce. 

“Yes!” cries Saul, lifting his axe high and rushing to back him up.

The shaggy grizzly knocks Zahgorim to the ground and pins her there. Saul brings down his axe at the weakest point of her armor, near the neck, and she’s hit—but most of the force seems to have gone into piercing the heavy plate armor rather than her flesh. 

Two orcs fling themselves onto Beifir and push him forcefully off of their general. Freed, she springs to her feet and thrusts her spear straight into Saul’s gut. 

Gunnloda swoops down and breathes acid onto the four orcs closest to the Zahgorim-Saul-Beifir conflict, melting them into gooey puddles before they can finish off Saul. But Saul knows as soon as he is hit that the blow is mortal. The pain renders him unable to speak.

Beifir is once again free to attack Zahgorim, and he does, successfully pinning her to the ground once more. It is slightly ill-timed with another acid attack from Gunnloda, who kills two more orcs, and wounds Zahgorim, but also hits Beifir. In the chaos of the moment, Zahgorim takes a small dagger from her belt and stabs Beifir. He returns to his elf form with a mouthful of Zahgorim’s blood dripping down his chin. She throws him off and is helped to her feet by two more orcs, who pull her back from the fray, presumably to treat her gruesome acid wounds.

Back in town, Surina is almost singlehandedly wiping out any orcs who make it past Patrick the mushroom elemental. She breathes fire onto four wily orcs, who sizzle and die. She beheads another one with her sword. But her mind is still on the red dragon: is it here to help, or to hurt? In her heart, she knows the answer, but it’s not the one she wants.

Another roar shakes the ground. It’s closer now, like a rapidly-moving thunderstorm, its intermittent flame breaths like red-orange lightning. Before anyone can believe it, it’s directly overhead—a colossal, full-sized adult red dragon.

Surina’s breath catches in her throat—then it disappears completely, watching it touch down on the edge of the wall—the dragon, swinging its tail, toppling the Razors Edge and sending Ma Thunderstruck and the entire engineering division flying—some of them hitting the ground wrong, so wrong, spines snapping audibly—another electrifying roar, and Surina feels the temperature of the air around her rise as the dragon breathes fire indiscriminately ahead—several nearby buildings are reduced to black wooden skeletons in the blaze—

She sprints toward the staircase to the watchtower, which somehow remains intact, blocking out the sounds of destruction and death that surround her from all sides. 

“Hey!” she hollers at the dragon. It barely glances her way. She switches to Draconic. “Speak to me! Why are you doing this?!”

It turns toward her. She feels the uncanny sense of being recognized, though she’s sure she’s never seen this dragon before in her life.

“AHA,” says the dragon, with a smirk. “I THOUGHT SO.”

“You thought what?” Surina shrieks. “Why?!”

“IT’S A PLEASURE TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE,” says the dragon. His voice cuts through the air like a sword made of diamonds. “I AM HERE TO DO SOME WORK, AND I CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE TOO.” 

His breath smells of fresh ashes against her face. 

“YOU AND I HAVE MUCH TO DISCUSS, I THINK. AS FOR THIS SIDESHOW, THE ELVES AND THE ORCS AND ALL… WELL, A DEAL IS A DEAL, SO I AM GOING TO DESTROY THE TOWN.”

He sighs, and the wave of heat pushes her back a few inches. 

“YOU WILL SURVIVE, I THINK. YOU LOOK STRONG. WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER, COME FIND ME. MY NAME…” He pauses. “MY NAME IS KIMBATUL GRIZZLEBY.”

“A deal?” Surina’s voice is hoarse. “A deal with whom?!” 

But there is no response from Grizzleby. Enraged, Surina unrolls a length of rope a from a clip on her belt and leaps onto the back of the dragon’s neck. She loops the rope around its snout and pulls it taut. 

“Answer me!” she cries.

Grizzleby chuckles. With a snap of his jaws, he breaks the rope as if it is a cooked noodle and takes to the air once again—now with Surina clinging to his back.

In the stunned moment after the dragon’s arrival, the battle takes a turn. Valmus lobs a Fireball at the remaining orcs inside the wall, while the mushroom guardian crushes another beneath its feet. But its time is running out. With a final puff of cinnamon-scented spores, Patrick sinks slowly back into the earth.

Over the battlefield, Gunnloda flies in distressed circles. The sight of the red dragon knocking down the Razors Edge and sending her closest colleagues to their deaths has provoked a rage in her heart she didn’t know was possible. She dives down at random, ripping heads off, without any particular strategy. 

Saul, struggling to stay on his feet after his wound from Zahgorim’s spear, faces a second wave of orcs approaching from the forest, and Zahgorim behind them, looking replenished. He readies his axe, but it feels exhaustingly heavy. Beifir, spitting chunks of orc flesh out of his mouth, readies to transform into a bear again.

“I think this is it,” says Saul. “It’s been an honor. Sorry for messing with you so much.”

“No,” says Beifir, “not yet.”

He wipes his mouth and then takes a running start, transforming into a bear in midair, leaping over the front line of orcs before them, and lands directly on top of Zahgorim. Before anyone can react, he bites through the neck of her armor and rips her throat open in a spray of dark blood. Then he punches a claw into the side of her face without the eye patch, crushing it. Zahgorim is dead.

The orcs at her side shrink back. Without their leader, they are directionless. Is it worth it to keep fighting, now that Gruumsh has failed them? 

The answer, it seems, is no. Within minutes, Zahgorim’s army has retreated, returning to the forest line. A cheer from the Silver Chain forces—heavily battered, but holding their ground—goes up from the battlefield. 

But the day is not won as long as Grizzleby circles the sky above Eillin. 

---

Surina, still hanging onto the dragon’s back, doesn’t dare look down. 

“Please!” she shouts, unsure if he can hear her over the howl of the wind and snow. “Don’t do this!”

Grizzleby, if he does hear her, says nothing. Instead, he flies low over the western side of Eillin and bathes a solid quarter of the town in flame.

“No!!!” screams Surina. 

“DRAGON-CHILD,” says Grizzleby. “DO YOU KNOW YOUR NAME?”

Surina, in terror, says nothing.

“I KNEW YOU AS SOON AS I SAW YOU,” says Grizzleby. “YOUR NAME IS KIMBATUL SURINA.”

The bitterly cold night air fades away, and Surina can see a memory—not her own memory, but one that feels like a story she used to know.

There is a cave, and a red dragon inside of it, and it is dead. 

A knight holding a sword and shield kneels to the ground and picks up an egg the size of an infant, lined with glimmering crimson scales. It twitches in his arms, then cracks, and a small bipedal humanoid creature with a dragon’s face breaks through. The knight takes a cloth and swaddles the newborn, tucking the fabric with care so that the insignia of the Order of the Silver Chain is visible in front. 

He turns, and she sees his face. It’s a much younger Sir Halbert Jonin, and this is her past.

---

On the emptying battlefield, Beifir returns to his elf form and limps over to Saul, who has sunk to his knees. Zahgorim’s spear remains lodged in his stomach. His face is pale, almost blue.

“Hold on, man,” says Beifir. “I’m going to carry you back to town, and we’ll get you healed up, okay? I’m going to turn into a bear again, and you just need to get on my back.”

“Don’t take me there,” says Saul. “It’s all on fire.” He grins, and a bit of blood dribbles from his lips. “It’s too late for me, nature boy. I only have one move left.”

“What are you talking about?” says Beifir, his eyes welling with tears. “Is this another thing where you’re going to sprout skeleton wings and pull a total wild card move?”

“Sort of,” says Saul, with a chuckle that decays into a bloody, sputtering death rattle. 

A sudden rush of wind swirls the snow into a miniature cyclone around Saul, and Beifir can make out a celestial voice inside it, if he concentrates with all his might.

*"Looks like you’re in a tough spot."*

Beifir strains to see Saul’s face, but the wind whips ice crystals into his eyes.

*"You’ve always stuck by your end of the bargain. I have one more for you, if you’d like to save these people and their little town."*

“Ha,” comes Saul’s voice. “I was going to call you.”

*"Indeed. This time I will need something more from you in return. In fact, I need you down here. Not forever, but for some time. Do you understand?"*

“I understand,” says Saul.

The cyclone dissipates, and Beifir sees a silver coin spinning in midair in front of Saul. 

“Beifir, tell the others I said goodbye,” says Saul.

“What?!” says Beifir. He tries to rush forward, but something heavy in the air holds him in place. “Please—we can figure something out—whatever you’re doing, you don’t have to—”

Saul holds up a hand. More blood escapes from between his lips and forms red blossoms on the snow. 

“My granddaughter was born a few months ago,” says Saul. A tear falls down his cheek. Then another. “I’m doing this for her." He smiles at Beifir. "Because there are things in this world worth saving.”

Beifir’s sobs take him by surprise. He shakes his head, but has no words.

“If you go back to Aberith, watch over her. Make sure she lives,” says Saul. “Her name is Kir Mirama.”

He grabs the spinning coin in front of him, and Beifir is knocked back by a wave of force that renders him momentarily breathless. 

The person before him is too bright to look at without shading his eyes, and even then, it hurts. And it’s not Saul anymore; at least, not in any recognizable way—the figure grows taller and taller and brighter and brighter until it can only be described as an angel, twelve feet tall—it has a woman’s face and a pair of horns, and it wields a flaming sword—a set of radiant white wings bursts from its back, and it’s far too bright. And Beifir can’t keep his eyes open any longer.

What happens next seems like a dream, or perhaps a hallucination, to everyone who witnesses it:

The angel who once was Saul floats above Eillin and holds out a hand that stops the red dragon mid-flight. Time freezes, except for the falling snow, glittering like tiny mirrors through the uncanny midnight light, blinding anyone who dares look up, who can’t look away.

The moment passes, and the red dragon laughs—not maliciously, but with surprise, and evident interest.

“FAIR PLAY,” says the dragon. “A PROTECTOR SUCH AS THIS, FOR A TOWN SUCH AS THAT? I CAN’T SAY I UNDERSTAND. BUT I’LL BACK OFF.”

Grizzleby turns to look at Surina, who lies flat against his back with her eyes shut tight.

“WILL YOU COME WITH ME, DRAGON-CHILD?” he asks her, in Draconic. “AS I SAID BEFORE, WE HAVE MUCH TO DISCUSS.”

Surina nods, unable to open her eyes or form words.

“VERY GOOD,” says Grizzleby. 

The dragon flies away to the northwest, toward the forest where the officers spent the previous night fruitlessly tracking Baromar Helviund, and disappears into the darkness.

The angel raises its flaming sword and sees that the dragon has parted and Zahgorim’s army has fled. Seeming satisfied by this, it begins to descend from the sky toward the ground. For a brief moment, when its feet touch the ground, it looks like Saul again: an old man, impaled by a spear, broken and dying. But then a pillar of flame surrounds him, and he sinks into a yawning pit of fire that swallows him whole. And then he’s gone.

---

The fires are all out by morning, thanks to quick thinking from Gitte and an old-fashioned bucket chain by the townsfolk. A third of the town’s structures are lost, but—as Ma Thunderstruck reminds them all, sporting a broken leg—it’s easy to rebuild things. It’s people you can’t replace.

Gunnloda begs Valmus not to end the polymorph spell that is keeping her in dragon form. If she’s herself again, she’ll have to see what happened to her squad. To Michele. To all but three of her direct reports. But of course, he can’t keep it up forever. The grief, when she faces it, is shattering. She leaves Eillin, and the Silver Chain, with a bitterness in her heart that she can’t help but feel is permanent. “McBitters,” she tells Ma on the night before she begins her trek to the northern mountains. “That’s my new name.”

Surina is gone for weeks. No one knows where she went.

Valmus, for his part, decides he’s seen enough of war—or he needs a break from it, at least. A long one. He packs up his things and heads for the forest, toward that lake that seemed so peaceful. It’ll be a change. He can always go back to Aberith, he tells himself, but it’s time for something new.

Beifir mourns Saul deeply, to the surprise of all who knew of their contentious relationship. He enters a depressive phase so morbid that it attracts the attention of Cazna, who joins him on walks through the forest at dusk. They trade thoughts on death and the inescapable pain of existence. Beifir even tries wearing her eyeliner a few times, but they both conclude that the look doesn’t suit him like it does her. The two of them eventually part ways, but for a short time in the *hyppää-ympäriinsä* of their lives, they are companions. 

And Saul? A funny thing happens to Saul.

As he descends into hell, he passes through many planes. Visions of worlds he’ll never know flash before his eyes. In one of them—the ethereal plane—he briefly crosses paths with a traveler making the journey in the opposite direction. It’s a young copper dragon, no more than a baby, really, who looks remarkably similar to the one Gunnloda became during battle. 

“Hey,” says Saul. “Do I know you?”

The dragon looks him in the eyes and smiles.

“NO, BUT I KNOW YOU,” the dragon says. “AND I LIKE YOUR STYLE.”

“My style?” says Saul.

“YEAH, I WATCH THINGS FROM THE ETHEREAL PLANE SOMETIMES,” says the dragon. “THAT ONE TIME YOU SHAPE-SHIFTED INTO A DROW WOMAN ON THE ROAD AND GOT THE DROP ON THOSE BANDITS?” He laughs. “AND THE THING WITH THE BLUE CONE, TOO... IT WAS ALL REALLY GOOD.”

“Thanks,” says Saul, actually quite touched. He rummages in his pockets for a small, well-worn book. *Tricky Jokes for VERY Cool Boys*. He tosses it to the dragon, who catches it. “There’s a lot more where that came from.”

The ethereal plane is beginning to fade from view, and the dragon swims in and out of reality.

“THIS IS FANTASTIC,” Saul hears the dragon say.

“Have fun,” says Saul, before he passes on.

It's late at night, and a waxing crescent moon dimly illuminates the fallen bodies of Zaghorim's broken army, scattered over the snowy field. The town's defenders have extinguished Grizzleby's flames, and are busy within the walls, tending to the wounded, cataloging the dead, and quietly celebrating their victory. The orcs were left on the field as tomorrow's problem, though the priests know that proper burial and consecration will be important to avoid the emergence of ghouls.

A solitary figure creeps from the northwestern treeline and makes her way across the battlefield in short sprints, timed with clouds crossing the moon. At last, she reaches her goal: the crushed body of Zaghorim, staring sightlessly at the night sky. She knows that most souls here were absorbed by the flaming sword of that angel, but that a true daughter of Gruumsh has unusual protection...

She quietly sketches the circle around Zaghorim, noting with satisfaction that it does, indeed, pulse dimly. She withdraws a transluscent sphere from her belt and holds it closely over the warchief's still heart. She closes her eyes and lets the Matriarch come—and she feels the orb quicken, turning a cloudy green, as it absorbs the soul of Grummsh's champion.

"Gotta catch 'em all!" Yasvayas Do'Val whispers to herself, as she scurries back to the long, looping path that will bring her back to the tower, and the great work.
