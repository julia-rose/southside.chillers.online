After a night’s rest, the officers of the Silver Chain Company are poised to begin the final leg of their journey to Eillin. They are now within ten miles of the town limits. The thought of sleeping on a surface other than cold, rocky earth has Valmus packed up and ready before the others have fully emerged from slumber. His voice has all but disappeared during the night, however. The exertion of his magic use the night before has left him hoarse, with a throbbing sore throat and bloodshot eyes. Still, his enthusiasm to continue is contagious.

“Yes, all right,” sighs Beifir, the last to leave his bedroll, upon being nudged in the gut by Valmus’s boot. 

They pass through the area where they fought the orcs the previous night. 

“Did any of you move the bodies?” asks Surina. 

Nobody responds. It’s true: the dead orcs are nowhere to be seen. The only evidence of the battle is the scorched patches of ground where Valmus’s fireball and Saul’s unholy flames did their deadly work. 

The road toward Eillin is well-maintained this close to the town. Beifir feels like there’s not much for him to do—it’s unlikely that there will be any environmental dangers. At least he can stay ahead of the group to warn them of any impending encounters with other travelers. And, when they’re about five miles out from town, he spies a lone figure skirting the edge of the road.

He reports back to the group.

“Was this person armed?” asks Gunnloda.

“Yes,” says Beifir. “A half-elf. She carried a crossbow, and probably more that I didn’t see. But she’s on her own, and we could take her if it came to a fight.”

“She might be saying the same about you to her own group,” says Gunnloda. “But let’s try diplomacy first.”

“Gunnloda!” says Surina. “I’m proud of you. I know attack mode is your default.”

Gunnloda grunts.

Beifir jogs ahead, not bothering to be stealthy. 

“Well met!” he calls, once the woman is again in range. 

“Well met,” the woman responds levelly. Her crossbow remains in her hand, but she does not raise it. “I am Rathi Kesk, protector of Eillin. What do you call yourself?”

“Beifir Järvinen,” says Beifir. “Senior Scout for the Silver Chain Company.”

“Aha,” says Rathi. “We’ve been expecting you.” She glances at the ground, then up at him again. “Cricket,” she says.

Beifir smiles. Halbert Jonin told them to expect this.

“Silver,” he replies. 

Rathi holds out a hand. He walks toward her and shakes it.

“We’re so glad you’re here,” she says. “We’d be happy to escort you to town.”

“We?” asks Beifir.

Rathi whistles, and a drow man and human woman emerge from the trees behind her.

“The Eillin Rangers,” she says. “We monitor the town limits and surrounding forests. Keep an eye on any potential threats to Eillin.”

“Honored to meet you.” Beifir bows.

“Now, did the Silver Chain send just the one of you?” asks Rathi.

“Oh, no,” says Beifir. “The other officers are just down the road.” He makes his own whistling signal, reminiscent of the trill of a gray catbird.

Surina appears first, followed by Gunnloda, Valmus, and Saul. 

“These are the Eillin Rangers,” says Beifir. “They have offered to lead us into town.”

“Greetings,” says Surina. “I am Surina, Sergeant and Captain of the officers of the Silver Chain Company. What news of the orc horde?”

“Not much, I’m afraid,” says Rathi. “We’ve had scattered encounters with individual orcs during the past few weeks, but the army is still days from Eillin.”

“Might I ask,” says Saul, quietly, so as to force Rathi to hold her breath to listen, “with which operative of the Silver Chain are you in contact?”

“I receive orders from Bynrize,” says Rathi. She looks him square in the eyes. “He assures me you are trustworthy.”

Saul says nothing. His expression is unreadable.

“You know why we’re here,” says Gunnloda. “Lead the way, if you would.”

“Gladly,” says Rathi.

Valmus, whose voice is barely more than a tortured whisper, writes a note to Surina on a pad of parchment.

“He wants to know more about Bynrize, and any recent news from town,” Surina explains. “Valmus, by the way. He’s our attaché. Normally, he’d be talking your ear off, but he did a bit of extravagant magic last night and he’s blown out his voice.”

“My sympathies, Valmus,” says Rathi, smiling. “Bynrize is the mayor of Eillin. He’s a little eccentric, but he’s a smart man, and the people trust him. As for news—well, usually, the area is peaceful and quiet. Mostly gourd farmers, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, and they’re not an excitable lot. But every century or so, some orc or another gets enough followers together to go marauding, and it looks like that’s what’s happening now. People are pretty tense. Worried about their families and homes.”

“Forgive my ignorance,” says Beifir, “What are they looking for in Eillin? I’m from the far west. We don’t traffic much with orcs.”

“Oh, yes, I could tell by your accent,” says Rathi. Beifir blushes. “And, well, I don’t know any orcs personally. I’ve never met one I didn’t immediately kill. I guess that explains a lot, in retrospect.” She pauses, considering the cycle of violence that defines her life. “As far as I know, they just appear and cause mayhem until someone beats them back. Sometimes they take valuables. Often they just want an excuse to fight.”

“By any chance, did you notice the moon turning red last night?” asks Surina.

“The red moon!” cries Rathi. “I was hoping you could tell me what that was all about.”

“Afraid not,” says Surina. “But it’s helpful to know that we weren’t the only ones who saw it.”

They walk on in silence for another few minutes.

“So, what measures have been taken so far to protect the town?” asks Surina. “We’d like to be as helpful as we can be as soon as we arrive.”

“It is a relief to hear you say that,” says Rathi. “We have a basic log wall, but nothing that would stop a determined adversary. We’ll want to set up some heavier fortifications—”

“Fortifications!” yelps Gunnloda. She is alert, as if awakened by a magic keyword.

“Yes, fortifications,” says Rathi.

“What kind of materials do you have?” asks Gunnloda.

“A lot of wood,” says Rathi. “We have some decent craftsmen, but if there’s one thing we lack, it’s little shaped pieces of metal—you know, to hold everything together.”

Gunnloda gasps.

“*I* have little shaped pieces of metal!”

“We’ll put you right to work, then,” says Rathi.

They come to the crest of a hill, and from here, they can see the town of Eillin, surrounded by a low wooden wall. Its most prominent features are a temple with a red glass moon sigil on its spire, an imposing multi-tiered house with black walls, and a domed tower on a hillock at the edge of town. 

“What’s that big black building?” asks Surina.

“Oh, that’s Helviund House,” says Rathi. She starts to roll her eyes, but catches herself and passes it off as a blink.

“What’s a Helviund?” asks Beifir.

“Ask one of them, and they’ll tell you all day,” she mutters. “No, I’m kidding. They’re one of the more traditional drow houses in town. We’re all friends these days, of course, but… sometimes they can be a little much.”

“Are they a nuisance?” asks Gunnloda.

“I wouldn’t want to speak out of turn,” says Rathi, coloring slightly. Her companions—a human and a drow—say nothing.

Valmus points at the domed tower on the hill. 

“Mayor Bynrize and his family live there,” Rathi explains. “Actually, I’ll let him know you’re here. He’ll probably want to speak with you in a bit. In the meantime, when we get in, I’d suggest exploring the market. Lots of artisans in town, plenty of food. And later, we’d love to buy you a drink over at the Gourd.”

Saul gestures toward the temple with the moon sigil.

“And this is your temple to Eilistraee, yes?” 

“Well-spotted,” says Rathi. “You’d be welcome to pay your respects there, if you wish.” She turns and starts to jog backwards toward town. “I’m going to run ahead and talk to Bynrize, but meet me at the Gourd later! Right in the town square. Can’t miss it.”

The other two Eillin Rangers silently speed up to follow her, leaving the Silver Chain officers alone as they approach the gate.

“Oh, this is quite insufficient,” gasps Gunnloda, when the true scale of the log wall becomes evident. It is barely twice the height of Beifir, and parts of the wood are in obvious decay. “Oh, no, no, no.”

She breaks away from the group as soon as they pass through the gate, muttering to herself. 

“All right, then,” says Beifir. “I guess she’s going to audit the wall right away. Want to go to the market? We can see if there’s enough space to teleport in the troops.”

Valmus nods, but Surina shakes her head.

“I’m going to chat with Saul for a minute,” she announces. “We’ll meet up with you in the market in a bit.”

Beifir and Valmus share a look before heading off toward the town square, leaving Surina and Saul standing alone just inside the gate.

“I thought we should talk about last night,” says Surina. “Are you all right?”

Saul looks for a moment like he’s about to respond, but then purses his lips, saying nothing.

“I need to know what we’re dealing with in order to properly lead this group,” Surina continues. “What happened back there?”

“I know,” says Saul, exhaling heavily. “I know it was strange. I…” He falls silent again, his eyes scanning the ground. “There was a time when the odds were against me.” He looks up at Surina. “And I’m not entirely clear how, but I came into some new powers.”

Surina fixes him with her gaze, unblinking. She has always found Saul more difficult to read than the others. If he’s lying to her, she’s not sure she could tell.

“My faith in Pelor was shaken,” he continues. “But I still have the best interests of the Company in my heart.” A gust of wind causes the gate’s hinges to moan from behind them. Saul’s hair whips into his face, and for a moment, Surina sees him as he might have been in a different world—an old man, a grandfather perhaps, worn and vulnerable. “I’ll be careful. I promise.”

“I trust you,” says Surina. “And yet I must ask you the source of these new powers, for the sake of our colleagues, and of the Order we represent.”

Saul’s face is again inscrutable, with no trace of softness.

“Once, the source was purely Pelor,” he says. “Now… it’s something different.”

Moments pass. He doesn’t continue. Surina knows if she asks again, or pleads, the balance of power will shift. She tries to convince herself that she does not need to know.

“Your business is your own,” she concludes. “If we see you losing control, how shall we intervene?”

Saul smiles, barely.

“I don’t think you’ll need to worry about it,” he says.

“We’ll see, won’t we,” says Surina, more a statement than a question. 

They walk to the town square in a sort of cordial detente, commenting on the shops and market stalls they pass. They find Beifir and Valmus standing in the crowded forum, waving their arms furiously toward inattentive shoppers.

“People! Listen up!” Beifir calls through a cupped hand. “By order of the Silver Chain Company, you will need to vacate the town square!” A trio of rambunctious drow children collide with him, knocking him backward; they continue shrieking and running. “This area will need to be cleared in order to—this is for your own protection!”

Valmus makes his eyes glow and attempts an imposing stance, but without his voice, he mostly comes across as a particularly striking and fashionable mime. An old woman tosses a silver piece at his feet. Valmus frowns.

“I think we’ll need to speak to the mayor before we bring in the troops,” says Surina. “Let’s go see him now. We can grab Gunnloda on the way.”

They encounter her puttering around the wall, not far from the front gate. She holds a mallet in one hand and strikes the beams of timber with it at various intervals.

“See this?” she calls to them when she notices their approach. “Rotten! Rotten wood! Pieces of it coming off with each hit!” She shakes her head, livid. “We have our work cut out for us here. Thank goodness we traveled at the pace we did. A pair of *gnomes* out for a *picnic* could strike this wall down in seconds!”

“We’re going to speak to Mayor Bynrize,” says Surina. “He’ll authorize us to bring in the rest of the Company, and then you’ll have your engineers to help with the wall.”

“Yes, yes,” says Gunnloda. She stows the mallet back in her toolkit and wipes her brow. “No time to waste.”

Up close, the observatory on the hill is rather stunning, not just architecturally, but in the obvious care put into its upkeep. The path that winds to its front door is lined with manicured rose bushes sporting an odd combination of sunset orange and pale peach-colored blooms. The door opens before Surina has a chance to knock, and a tall drow man wearing a long, silvery robe stands before them, smiling.

“Welcome!” he proclaims, spreading his arms wide. “Come in, please, officers, come in, if you would! I am Bynrize, and it is my honor to receive you!” He waves all of them through the threshold. “Would you care for some tea?”

“Ooh,” says Beifir. “Yes please. Do you have Bittersweet Menninkäinen, by any chance?”

“Of course!” says Bynrize. “Exquisite flavor. Such nuance. And a discerning selection for one so young! Beifir Järvinen, isn’t it?”

“Yes,” says Beifir, with some surprise. “You’re the first person to pronounce that correctly in years.”

“I traveled to the western forests once, in my youth—such a beautiful country,” says Bynrize. “Please, make yourselves comfortable in the parlor while I brew the tea! Anyone else for tea?” He guides them into a sitting room decorated in a sophisticated, minimalist style. “I do have other leaves—a milder Earl Fey, or a bracing Bugbear Breakfast?” No one answers. “Just the Menninkäinen, then—I’ll brew a full pot in case anyone else would like to try.”

He hums to himself as he exits to the kitchen, while the officers sit awkwardly on his very modern furniture. 

“We came by to ask for your blessing to begin the mission soon,” Surina calls to him.

“Yes, yes! The mission!” comes Bynrize’s voice. “That is the reason we are all here, is it not?”

“Yeah,” says Gunnloda. She already looks desperate to leave. “So, can we teleport our people in?”

Bynrize pops his head back into the parlor, smiling broadly at her.

“You must be Gunnloda. Daughter of Smunnloda.”

“You got me,” says Gunnloda. “Smunnloda’s little girl.”

“I met your mother once,” says Bynrize. “Many years ago. A full two centuries, if I’m not mistaken. Mighty warrior. Quite a character, too!”

“Yes,” says Gunnloda. Her eyes dart toward the door.

“Delighted to meet you,” says Bynrize. “And you must be the valiant dragonborn, Surina!”

“What gave it away?” chuckles Surina.

“I have heard tell of your valor in battle and fairness in leadership,” says Bynrize. “Your reputation precedes you, and it is *sterling*, rest assured!”

He disappears back into the kitchen and returns moments later with a pot of tea and a stack of delicate china cups. 

“Now, I must insist that the first cup must go to our friend Valmus here,” he says. “I can’t imagine the man with the silver tongue has been silent for this long without reason—frog in your throat, perhaps?”

He pours a steaming cup of pale tea and hands it to Valmus, who receives it with a nod and a quizzical look. Does he know about the frog, somehow?

“And of course, another for our scout,” says Bynrize, and passes another cup to Beifir. “I’ll have some, too, myself. I’m sure you know it’s been a dark time in Eillin of late, and the stress is beginning to get to me! But I think hope is on the horizon…”

“Why?” says Gunnloda.

“Why what?” says Bynrize.

“Why do you think that? About hope being on the horizon?”

“Ah, well, such stalwart warriors as yourselves having arrived, how could it not be?” cries Bynrize. He raises his teacup and clinks it against Valmus’s and Beifir’s. “To the Silver Chain, and to Eillin!”

Valmus sips. It’s hot, and it does feel nice on his throat, but the flavor is not something he’d ever think to consume purposefully. Beifir, on the other hand, closes his eyes in apparent bliss.

“Tastes like home,” he sighs. “Thank you, Mayor Bynrize. We hope our presence—and the eventual presence of our full Company, of course—brings you some peace of mind in this difficult situation. We’ll do nothing short of our best to provide Eillin with the reinforcements it needs to fend off the incoming threat, and you should feel confident in our ability to do so.” He takes another sip, then continues. “All that said, I should mention that when I tried to interact with the citizens earlier, to clear the square in order to bring our troops in, they seemed unwilling or perhaps unaware of the necessity to—”

“What my long-winded friend here is trying to say is,” interrupts Saul, “how do you recommend we clear enough space for our soldiers to teleport into Eillin all at once? We’re using Halbert Jonin’s silver gauntlets, as I’m sure he told you.”

Bynrize laughs for a solid thirty seconds before responding.

“You must be Saul!” he says.

“That’s right,” says Saul.

“Saul Kegan. A man who has sacrificed much.”

“Mm,” says Saul, in neither an explicit confirmation nor a denial.

“It is excellent to meet you, Saul Kegan.”

The sound of footsteps stomping down a staircase interrupts the moment. Seconds later, a diminutive figure in a black hood appears in the threshold of the parlor. The figure freezes at the apparently unexpected sight of the officers, and then makes a dash toward the front door.

“Ah ah ah! Not so fast, Cazna!” says Bynrize. “Where are your manners? Please say hello to our guests.”

The figure turns toward them. She’s an adolescent drow girl wearing heavy black eyeliner and carrying a notebook.

“Hi,” she says.

She scurries out the door and slams it behind her.

“Ah, youth,” says Bynrize with a wistful smile. “Such a magical time.”

Beifir cranes his neck to see out the front windows, watching her retreat down the side of the hill.

“Who was that?” he asks, voice calculatedly offhand.

“My daughter, Cazna,” chuckles Bynrize. “She’s going through a phase.”

“And does she go to school in Eillin, or…?” 

“Yes, yes! Exams coming up, I’m afraid, so she rarely has time for her old man!” Bynrize sighs exaggeratedly.

“Exams,” says Beifir. “Yes. A recent memory for me.” He clears his throat. “In fact, I’m currently on my *hyppää-ympäriinsä*, which we take directly after completing our formal schooling in the west, so I’m not much older than your daughter.”

“Yes, well, how about that!” says Bynrize gaily.

“So, is Cazna—”

Everyone else in the room is visibly relieved when Surina interrupts this line of questioning.

“Mayor Bynrize, sir, we thank you for your hospitality,” she says. “It is our honor and our duty to defend your town. Before we get started, we wondered if we might request a map of Eillin—the one we have on hand is a touch outdated. And then we’d like to request your help in clearing the town square for the arrival of our troops.”

“Of course, Surina, of course,” says Bynrize. He procures a scroll from his pocket and hands it to her. “This is the very latest map of Eillin. I hope you’ll find it useful. And as for the town square, the marketplace usually concludes its business hours just before sunset. If you can wait until then, the citizens will be out of your way with no interruption to their routine.”

Surina looks pleased; Beifir looks perturbed.

“Sunset?” he says. “I wonder if we could impose upon you for a spot of lunch in the meantime?”

“I would be *delighted* to offer you all the provisions you might need, dear boy!” says Bynrize. “You have come such a long way from Aberith. Please, allow me to prepare a spread of some of my favorites, and you must all help yourselves.”

Bynrize disappears into the kitchen. Beifir hops up from his geometrically-shaped chair and begins circling the parlor, peering up at the framed paintings on the walls. He sees several family portraits: a smiling couple (clearly Bynrize and an unknown woman) with a pudgy baby; a happy drow girl in pigtails, holding a stuffed bear; an abruptly solemn-faced drow teenager sporting a less-elegant prototype of Cazna’s current look. There’s another portrait of a younger Bynrize receiving his degree, and one more portrait of a severe-looking woman alone, an older version of the woman from the first family portrait.

“Is this your wife?” calls Beifir.

The sound of Bynrize chopping ingredients stops.

“Sorry?” 

“Oh, I’m just admiring this portrait you have in the parlor. This very striking woman. May I ask who this is?”

“Aha,” says Bynrize, and the sound of chopping resumes. “Yasvayas and I have had a difficult relationship, and ‘wife’ is no longer the proper word to use, I’m afraid.”

Valmus buries his face in his hands.

“Oh,” says Beifir. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—”

Saul stands up in apparent exasperation and pulls Beifir aside.

“Listen,” he says. “If you ask questions about every woman you see in this guy’s house, you’re going to come off like a little bit of a creep, okay?”

“Hey!” says Beifir, instantly red in the face. “I’m just trying to show interest! I’m making an effort, unlike you!”

"*Oh, I’m your daughter’s age, isn’t that funny! Oh, your ex-wife’s so beautiful!*" Saul mimics, whispering. “Calm down a little. Just an old man’s advice.”

“Fine,” says Beifir, pulling away. He sits back down on his geometric chair, his feathers quite ruffled.

Bynrize reappears in the parlor looking placid and cheerful as ever. He holds a platter of meats, cheeses, and breads, with a few jars of wild fruit preserves, honey, and tapenade for good measure. 

“Now, dig in, everyone,” he says. “You must be ravenous from your journey!”

In fact, they are, and the food is delicious. In two bites, Surina downs a sandwich constructed from hearty, herb-crusted bread, several thin slices of owlbear steak, and a creamy soft cheese that Bynrize identifies as auroch gournay. She is unaware of a sprig of rosemary stuck between her fangs when she brings the conversation back to business.

“So, Bynrize, how did you first hear of the impending orc threat?”

“I was hoping you’d ask,” he says. “In fact—let me show you!”

Reluctantly abandoning their charcuterie, the officers follow him up a spiral staircase to the second floor. They pass a room full of oddly-shaped glassware filled with liquids of many colors. Bynrize grabs a bubbling yellow one and takes a sip as they walk past.

“Refreshing!” he says. “That’s been brewing up nicely. Anyway, come, come.”

He ushers them into the next room, which is empty except for a large bronze disc that hangs on the far wall. He gestures for them to sit on the floor. He sinks to his knees beneath the disc and begins whispering an incantation.

Dark shapes begin to appear on the surface of the disc—first shadowy outlines, then remarkably vivid images. They see a series of forest scenes, quiet and unremarkable, similar to the forests they traveled through to reach Eillin. Out of the forests are meadows, and beyond those, an arid, rocky plateau. There is a long road, and at the end of it, a dark, cloudy mass. The images on the disc become clearer and clearer until an army of hundreds can be seen. Orcs, armored and marching, on the road toward Eillin. At the front, a tall orc woman wearing a red eyepatch leads the way. She is flanked by more orcs in religious garments. She carries a massive scimitar on her back. 

“If my sources are correct,” murmurs Bynrize, “that is Zahgorim herself, and she is well on her way to us.”

Valmus points at a fuzzy shape behind Zahgorim. Bynrize nods.

“A war wagon, yes,” he says. “Covered in furs. I haven’t been able to tell what’s inside.” He laughs drily. “Nothing good.”

“This is incredible!” says Beifir. “What else do you watch through here?”

Bynrize either does not hear the question or chooses not to respond. Saul elbows Beifir in the ribs.

“Thank you, Bynrize,” says Surina, her voice solemn. “It is good to know precisely what we are up against. We will return to town and begin our preparations in earnest as soon as the market clears.”

---

Eillin’s vendors finally begin packing up their wares as the sky begins to glow pink in the west. The officers gather in the emptying square. Gunnloda procures the left-hand gauntlet from her backpack and slips it on, the armored plates gleaming in the warm light. 

“Are you sure you’re up for the ritual?” asks Surina, looking at all the people still milling about the perimeter. 

“Of course,” says Gunnloda. “Why wouldn’t I be?”

“No reason,” says Surina quickly. “Just checking.”

Gunnloda walks to the center of the square and closes her eyes. Then, with an odd jerk of her shoulders, she begins to dance. It’s a series of sliding, stepping, and criss-crossing of legs that is not especially complicated, but it seems to require [every ounce of Gunnloda’s concentration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZv62ShoStY) to execute properly. At one juncture, she starts clapping her hands furiously, and the townsfolk who watch begin to applaud along with her, cheering and hollering. The dance gradually tapers off into a steady forward and back motion with rather more arm movement than seems necessary, but the ritual is working—the gauntlet on her left wrist glows with a silver light that soon bursts from her palm to form a shimmering portal.

Everyone gasps, even the officers, who knew to expect it. Gunnloda smiles and bows deeply to the crowd. Within the portal, they can all see Halbert Jonin, head of the Order of the Silver Chain. He waves, then stands aside, and the infantry begin pouring through the portal, materializing in flesh and blood and armor as the sun sets over Eillin.
