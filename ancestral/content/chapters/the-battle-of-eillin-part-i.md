Luckily for Valmus, they are not late for the invasion. They are, however, quite cranky after trudging back through the woods all night.  They return to Eillin just before sunrise. The town’s slumbering skyline is indigo against the lavender horizon, sublime in this silk-soft light, but it might as well be beige-on-beige for all they care.

“Thanks for that excellent use of sixteen hours of our time, Valmus,” Gunnloda grumbles as they wait for the gate to swing slowly open for them. “I’m sure no one here needed anything from us during the past two thirds of a day.” 

“You didn’t have to follow me,” snaps Valmus. He rubs his temples. “Ugh. Anyone else have a headache? I have the worst headache.”

“You just need sleep,” says Surina.

“No, it’s… the energy feels wrong,” says Valmus. “The ley lines are all out of whack, or something. It’s messing with my head.”

Gunnloda rolls her eyes theatrically. She is cut off from making a sassy retort, however, by the appearance of Gitte Florenzia, who jogs up to them as they pass through the gate. 

“Orcs should arrive by tonight,” she says breathlessly. “Where have you been? We were starting to get worried.”

“The woods,” says Saul, without offering further details. Gitte stares at him, then looks expectantly to Beifir.

“It doesn’t matter now,” sighs Beifir. “What other news?”

“There’s a dwarf woman with a giant machine on wheels who says she’s looking for you all,” says Gitte. “I told her to go wait at the Gourd, but that was twelve hours ago.”

“Ma!” says Gunnloda. “I should go talk to her. She needs to teach me how to use the—”

“No,” says Surina. “No, there’s no use doing anything else until we’ve had some rest. We’re exhausted, and we need to be sharp tonight.”

Each of the others thinks about disputing this, but says nothing. In silence, they retreat to the inn to salvage what they can of the early morning before the siege preparations must truly begin.

---

The snowfall starts before noon. By twilight, it has formed a crystalline blanket over every surface, glowing blue and gold in the light of the Silver Chain soldiers’ torches and the candlelit windows lining the streets. It piles up in sloping drifts against the newly-reinforced wall. 

The anticipatory tension in the air—or is it merely discomfort caused by shifting ley lines?—is visible in the faces of the citizens of Eillin. Bynrize, who has been carrying little Frunk Thunderstruck on his shoulders all day, gathers them in the town square as the last cloud-dampened light fades from the sky. 

“The first snow of the season!” he cries, looking up, making sure to grip Frunk’s ankles to keep him from falling. “And on a night of great import for our little village. I pray the gods send their blessings and protection with the weather.”

Three priestesses from the Temple of Eilistraee join him in front of the crowd bearing a harp, a flute, and a bodhrán. They begin to play a simple, upbeat melody, and Bynrize sings; his voice is surprisingly powerful, and it’s distinguishable even when the rest of the townsfolk join in. It’s a winter carol, and though none of the Silver Chain soldiers know the words, they applaud enthusiastically when it’s over. Baby Frunk finds all of it thrilling. He pounds rhythmically on Bynrize’s head, chanting “Un-cle Byn! Un-cle Byn!”

Surina feels her throat constrict with emotion. *Pelor, please don’t let us fail these people,* she thinks to herself. She glances over at Saul, who stands next to her. To her surprise, she sees a tear rolling down his cheek, his gaze fixed at the toddler on Bynrize’s shoulders. 

“Join me inside, my dear friends!” says Byn, ushering the townsfolk toward the Temple of Eilistraee. “We must let our guests from Aberith take it from here, and trust in their great skill at fighting foes such as these.”

The officers watch as drow and half-elf families file into the temple, some carrying their most prized possessions with them. The only Eillin natives who remain outside are Rathi Kesk and her Rangers, along with a few volunteers wearing the sigils of the Weavers and the Moon Gazers. 

“Quiet,” says Rathi, holding up a hand. The Silver Chain soldiers gradually cease their chatter. “Do you hear that?”

Over the groaning wind, the sound of voices and drums can be heard in a distant, terrible pulse. 

“GRUUMSH! GRUUMSH! GRUUMSH!”

“Time to take position,” says Surina. “Engineers, follow Gunnloda and Ma Thunderstruck. You will be operating the machine.”

“I’ve dubbed it *The Razors Edge*!” announces Ma, proudly. “It shoots exploding barrels!”

“Yes, very good,” says Surina. “Archers, follow Rathi Kesk and line the wall on either side of the gate. Infantry, gather at the gate and await my command.” 

The bustle of everyone taking their places is loud enough to drown out the far-off chanting, but it’s still there in the back of everyone’s minds. The officers climb up the staircase of the watchtower that abuts the hinges of the gate and look out across the snowy field to the forest, where small dots of flame can be seen illuminating a dark mass of bodies just at the treeline.

“I’m going to try to get a closer look,” says Beifir. He spots a white-feathered owl circling above, nearly blending into the swirl of snow. His eyes roll back into his head. “I’m the owl now,” he says. 

The others watch as the snowy owl abruptly changes course toward the forest. It disappears into the trees.

“I see the war wagon,” says Beifir. “Still covered in furs. Can’t tell what’s inside. A few burly guys pulling it along. And—there’s Zahgorim. She’s walking out of the forest now; you’ll see her.”

From afar, the officers on the wall see the shape of a heavily-armored orc woman illuminated by flickering torches. Her red eye patch is gleaming in the low light as if bedazzled with gemstones. Without orders, complete silence falls along the edge of the wall. The only sound is the soft patter of snow falling on armor. Zahgorim raises a fist into the air. The moment hangs heavy in time, like waiting for a rainstorm. She points toward the wall, and the front line of her infantry breaks into a run toward the wall.

“Nock arrows!” shouts Surina. The archers comply, their bowstrings pulled tight. 

“Ready a barrel!” Gunnloda says to Michele Gotthold, who stands atop the Razors Edge.

“They’re still too far out, yet,” says Ma, from beside her. “We won’t hit ‘em.”

“I said *ready* it!” says Gunnloda. “I didn’t say ‘fire’.”

The charging orcs are slowed by the heavy snow, but their approach is imminent. Surina looks toward Saul and Valmus.

“We’ll need a Ray of Frost and a pair of Eldritch Blasts, as soon as they’re close enough,” she says. The two of them nod. Valmus conjures a vortex of shocking cold, noticeable even in the current weather, in one hand, while Saul’s palms crackle with a disturbing dark energy.

Surina waits until the charging orcs are within firing range.

“Now!” she cries. “Archers, fire! Saul, Valmus, fire! Gunnloda, hold!”

A volley of arrows, along with Saul’s Eldritch Blasts and Valmus’s Ray of Frost, hits the front line of orcs. Five of them fall decisively into the snow, but a couple dozen more continue.

“I’m deeper in the woods now,” says Beifir. “I can see bats—giant bats—with orc riders. Perched in the trees.” He pauses. “The bats notice me. I don’t think they can tell I’m anything but an owl—but they see me.” Another pause. “Maybe they can tell. I’m going to dismiss the owl.”

His eyes return to normal. The first wave of orcs is only a few yards away now.

“Surina,” says Saul, “Wall of Fire in front of the gate? There are too many to take out one by one.”

“Yes, good idea,” says Surina. 

Saul makes a gesture as if he is pulling up weeds from the ground ahead of the gate. A twenty-foot-tall wall of flame bursts up through the snow, melting a line of orcs in an instant kill. Six of them go down, and then two more attempt to struggle through the flame but fall quickly to their deaths. 

“I can’t keep this going forever,” says Saul, “but we have a few minutes.”

Through the wall of fire, the officers see Zahgorim signal for the surviving front line to retreat. Then she points behind her. The bulky shape of the war wagon emerges from the treeline.

“Gitte!” says Beifir. His scout squad leader appears by his side, awaiting instructions. “Go to the temple and check on the townsfolk. We need to be aware of their status and any movements at all times.”

“Roger that,” says Gitte. She sprints down the staircase and over the snowy streets like a rabbit. In no more than ninety seconds, she returns, panting. “They’re praying to Eilistraee, sir. It’s nigh on heartbreaking, sir. They’re all holding hands. It’s... extremely wholesome.”

“Damn,” says Beifir. “Okay, thanks, Gitte.”

“Archers, nock arrows!” cries Surina. “Fire!” 

Through the flame barrier, another five retreating orcs go down. The officers have a moment of reprieve while the enemy regroups. 

“The war wagon is moving,” says Gunnloda. “What do you think? Is it close enough now to hit?”

“Don’t reckon so,” says Ma. “Cyclops out there’s too crafty to bring all her goodies close enough for ranged attacks.”

As Saul’s Wall of Fire begins to descend back into the earth, the officers see some orcs remove the furs from atop the war wagon and take out several ladders and battering rams.

“Valmus, ready a Fireball,” says Surina. “Gunnloda, Ma, you have a barrel loaded? We’re going to want to destroy as many ladders as we can as soon as they’re close enough.”

The burly orcs holding ladders and battering rams initiate the next charge. 

“Aiming for the left flank,” says Valmus. 

Gunnloda pours the black powder into the compartment at the top of the Razors Edge while Ma strikes a match. Michele aims the barrel of the machine.

“Ready on the right flank,” he says.

“Lightin’ ‘er up!” cries Ma, touching the flame to the fuse and then dousing the match in snow. “Everybody on the wall, cover those ears!”

Gunnloda knows better than to disobey this time. 

In a remarkably synchronous pair of flaming arcs, Valmus launches his Fireball just as the Razors Edge blasts a barrel. The resulting twin explosions devastate the oncoming charge and leave steaming spots of darkened earth where, seconds before, orcs had trudged through snow. Half the ladders are broken and smoldering along with eight of the orcs who carried them.

“That was good!” laughs Gunnloda, smiling at Ma. The rush of adrenaline from launching the cannon takes her by surprise. “That was amazing!”

“Sure was, sis!” says Ma, offering a fist bump, which Gunnloda enthusiastically returns. “Ain’t nothing like it, huh?”

But there are still several orcs with ladders and battering rams who continue past their fallen comrades, surrounded by shield-bearing bodyguards. 

“Beifir, Saul—try to take out the shields!” says Surina.

Beifir and Saul each take out a shield-bearing orc with Produce Flame and Eldritch Blast, respectively, but more spring up to take their places. Four ladders are swinging upright and finding purchase at evenly-spaced intervals along the wall. Three battering rams begin pounding at the gate—and though the engineers did good work reinforcing it, it won’t last forever.

“Damn it, damn it!” says Surina. “We need to prevent these ladders from going up! Try anything!”

Saul looks at her and pauses before speaking.

“There’s something I can do,” he says. He shuts his eyes tight and then opens them, shaking his head, as if screwing up the courage. “I’m sorry about this. Once the wings come out, look away.”

“Sorry about what?” asks Beifir, who stands beside him. “What wings? Saul?”

Saul shuts his eyes again, but this time, when he opens them, they are solid black. Two massive spikes of bone pierce out through the back of his armor at his shoulder blades and then begin unfolding into a set of skeletal wings.

“Look away!” he says again. 

A few Silver Chain soldiers nearby are too stunned to heed this directive, and many more of Zahgorim’s soldiers didn’t hear it at all. The sounds of terrified screams can be heard from both sides of the wall. About two dozen orcs, including two holding ladders and two holding battering rams, turn tail and run back toward Zahgorim in the distance. 

“Knew you were running some kind of grift on us, but didn’t realize it was this cool,” says Valmus, shielding his eyes. “Game recognize game, Saul.”

He shakes out his wings into their full width. The bones seem to drip with a ghostly, filmy material that rises like black smoke into the snowy air. The engineers along the wall grab the two abandoned ladders and pull them up and inside, chucking them to the ground behind them.

“Saul—I—I don’t know what to say,” says Surina. “We’ll talk later. Gunnloda, go down to the gate and survey the damage from the battering rams.”

“Send Valmus!” says Gunnloda, totally unfazed by recent developments. “Or Beifir! I’m preparing another barrel.”

But Beifir is in no shape to be assessing anything. Standing next to Saul on the wall’s edge, he keeps his arms over his face.

“What the hell, Saul!” he says. “What the *hell*!”

“What the hell, indeed,” says Saul, whose voice momentarily sounds demonic.

“Are you still on our side, or what?” says Beifir. “Is this—is this a prank?”

“I’m afraid it’s not a prank this time, nature boy,” he says, sounding faintly mournful. 

The orcs on the ground are in chaos, and Surina can’t let this opportunity slip.

“Valmus, then! Go check out the damage on the gate,” she says. 

“On it,” says Valmus, hustling down the stairs.

He sees that the gate is holding up fairly well, though the battering rams did shatter one of its hinges, forming a weak spot. He casts Mending on it, and the metal hinge glides back into its original unbroken state. He sprints back up the stairs, nearly slipping on the icy surface. 

“All fixed,” he reports. 

“Good,” says Surina. “Because we have a situation developing. Zahgorim is directing soldiers into a big wedge formation, surrounding someone who looks like a mage.” 

“Definitely a mage,” says Valmus, squinting out onto the battlefield. “He’s chanting something. Never a good sign.”

Beifir has collected himself somewhat now that Saul’s wings are beginning to resemble more smoke than bone and start to billow away into the night.

“I’m going to preemptively send some giant owls into the forest,” he announces, clearing his throat. “I want those bat riders distracted when Zahgorim gives them an order.”

“Very good,” says Surina. 

Beifir summons eight giant owls that look essentially like giant versions of the snowy owl he possessed earlier. They circle in the sky above him before soaring out in the direction of the forest. A few orc archers shoot arrows up at them, but their coloring provides some helpful camouflage against the snowy sky.

The two remaining orcs with ladders have climbed up to the wall. Surina begins a hand-to-hand fight with one of them, while Saul, whose wings have fully faded except for the memory of smoke, takes on the other. Surina punches her orc in the face so hard that he falls backward off the ladder and into the snow. She pulls up the ladder before another one can start to climb. Saul swings his axe and lodges it successfully in his orc’s neck. He has to shake the axe to get the body to fall, and then lifts up the second ladder as well.

Meanwhile, the wedge formation surrounding the chanting mage is making its way across the battlefield, heading straight for the gate. 

“We’re using our second barrel to get that mage!” shouts Gunnloda. “Ears covered in three—two—” 

The Razors Edge blasts another flaming projectile in a magnificent arc over the battlefield. Michele’s aim is true, and it seems headed straight for the mage—but several orcs surrounding him leap into the air above him to intercept the hit. It’s almost balletic in its precision and grace, except usually ten people do not die in a fiery mid-air explosion at the ballet. 

“Ugh!” cries Gunnloda. “What was that?! I wanted that mage!”

“We got one more barrel left,” says Ma. “Want to give it another shot to take him out?”

“I don’t think we have time,” says Gunnloda. “I think whatever spell he’s casting is making them move faster.”

Sure enough, the wedge formation is making unnaturally rapid progress across the snow. 

“Archers, fire!” shouts Surina. “Keep firing! We cannot let this mage reach the gate!”

A barrage of arrows falls on the orcs in the wedge, but no matter how many of them fall, the mage remains protected. If it weren’t so threatening, Surina would say it was an impressive display of teamwork and sacrifice in the service of a goal. With only a fraction of his bodyguards left, the mage breaks free of the wedge and dives toward the front gate.

“Brace yourselves!” cries Surina.

The explosion is catastrophic. The gate is blown to splinters, and the archers who stood on the section of wall beside it have been thrown backward onto the snow. Several are on fire; more are dead. With ears ringing, the officers can only hear assorted shrieking through the din. The chanting mage is dead, along with his remaining escorts, but the damage is done. In the distance, Zahgorim looks to be smiling.

“Beifir, call back those owls and have them guard the hole in the wall,” orders Surina, who is trying to douse the flames nearest to her before they spread further along the wall. 

“I have something better,” says Beifir. He takes the glowing blue mushroom Humphrey gave him from his pocket. “Humphrey said to plant this in the ground to summon a great protector.”

“Do it, then!” says Surina. 

Beifir runs down the stairs to the smoldering crater where the gate used to stand and places the blue mushroom in its center. At first, the mushroom only glows with a bright blue pulsating light, but then it starts to wiggle, and soon, it resembles the humanoid mushroom form of the angry red caps—but blue, and with a markedly more cheerful demeanor. In another few moments, the creature grows even larger, until it is an enormous shambling beast composed of thousands of smaller blue mushrooms, with a large, blue, conical cap on its head. It smiles at Beifir.

“Whoa,” says Beifir, taken aback. “Who are you?”

“Paaaaaa…” comes a deep, slow, sleepy voice from the creature’s face. It trails off.

“Okay, uh, we’re gonna call you Patrick,” says Beifir. “Your job is to protect this town from orcs, got it?”

“Eeeeeee,” says Patrick with a slow nod. A few more mushrooms sprout on his shoulders. He raises an elephantine foot and brings it down on an orc attempting to sneak past him and into the town. A few spores puff out from under his blue cap, and the scent of cinnamon is strong in the air.

“Good! Very good! Keep doing that!” says Beifir. 

Saul clambers down the stairs to stand next to him. There’s no suggestion of his necrotic shroud anymore—he looks like the tired old cleric Beifir thought he knew.

“We have orders to lead first infantry out onto the battlefield,” says Saul. “Surina is handling the fight inside the wall. Gunnloda’s on the Razors Edge. Valmus is staying hidden to cast his spells.” He offers his hand for a shake. “It’s just you and me.”

“Nature Boy, and who?” says Beifir, hesitating. “Who are you, Saul?”

“At this point, I’m just a guy with an axe, trying my best,” says Saul, shrugging his shoulders lightly. He starts to pull his hand back, his expression one of genuine regret. 

“Axe Boy, then,” says Beifir, with a tentative smile. He grabs Saul’s hand and shakes it. “All right. Nature Boy and—no. *Bear* and Axe Boy to the field. Climb on.”

With a growl, Beifir transforms into a grizzly and bends his knees to allow a pleasantly shocked Saul to climb onto his back.

“First infantry!” shouts Saul from his perch just behind Beifir’s shoulders. “To battle!”

The cheer that erupts from the bedraggled Silver Chain soldiers is ecstatic. Following the bear, they pour out of the wrecked gate on either side of Patrick the giant mushroom, who continues flattening orcs left and right with swipes of his limbs. 

“Maybe I should go too,” says Gunnloda, biting her lip. “Ma, Michele, you and the engineers can handle the Razors Edge without me. They need me out there on the field.”

“Wait a minute,” says Valmus. “If you’re going to go out, I have an idea. Just trust me. You’re going to love it. Go downstairs and leave some space for yourself.”

He holds up a hand and it begins vibrating with magical energy. When Gunnloda is out front with a wide berth between her and the nearest object, he points the energy down at her.

Where Gunnloda once stood is now a ten-foot-long copper dragon. Valmus grins at the dragon’s obvious surprise and delight in its new form, all bright metallic scales and wings.

“I have to keep concentration in order for you to stay like this,” he shouts down at her. “I’m going to retreat. Have fun.”

Gunnloda roars in thanks and takes immediate flight. Testing her powers, she swoops down on a group of orcs and hits them with acid breath, killing four. She then returns to the air above the battlefield, flying in victorious circles.

Valmus sneaks past the still-smoldering remains of some Silver Chain casualties on the inside of the exploded gate. He passes by a young soldier he recognizes as Geoffrey Torpleton, lying crumpled but alive in a bush. 

“Hey man,” says Valmus, “you all right?”

Torpleton’s eyes go wide. 

“Behind you!” he says, just in time for Valmus to turn around and see two orcs with scimitars raised. He casts Shield, and the scimitars fail to break through an invisible bubble around him. Surina, who has taken hands-on leadership of the second infantry inside the wall, beheads both orcs with a single swing of her sword.

“Whoa,” says Valmus. “Thanks, both of you.” He extends a hand to Torpleton, who takes it gratefully.

“No problem,” says Torpleton, clambering out of the bush and onto his feet. 

But their respite from the battle is short-lived. Valmus feels a sudden sharp, stabbing pain near the crown of his skull that echoes into a dull ache.

“This headache!” he groans. The ley lines, he knows, are entirely disrupted, whatever the others may think. Something is deeply wrong. 

A bright light appears in the sky, bursting orange through the snowfall, which is falling heavier than ever. A distant sound, almost like the roar he heard Gunnloda make minutes ago, but deeper, and more like the sound of a mountain splitting in half, reverberates from somewhere in the distance.

Surina’s eyes light up in spite of herself. She knows what it is, without even having to look. Something about that sound is more familiar to her than anything back home in Aberith—more fundamental to her being than her own name. She hears Gitte’s voice from back on the wall.

“Red dragon! Red dragon out of the northwest!”
