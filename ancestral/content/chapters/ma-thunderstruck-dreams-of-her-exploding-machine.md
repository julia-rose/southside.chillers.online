It looks as if the entire population of Eillin has gathered around the town square to watch the soldiers arrive. They chatter excitedly as the sky glows rosy-orange over the spires of the Temple of Eilistraee and the tiered roofs of Helviund House. The soldiers have the air of the big city about them. They crowd the marketplace and spill out into its surrounding streets.

“Torpleton! Step away from the livestock!” comes the voice of Nicholas Brenton, First Infantry squad leader. He hustles toward a young soldier with a mop of curly brown hair who has knelt down to pet the head of a civilian’s goat. “How many times do I have to tell you?”

Saul stands out of the way while Surina directs traffic. His attempts to avoid attention are unsuccessful, however, and a distinct subset of soldiers gravitates toward him. While the more youthful troops are happy to cavort amongst themselves, the soldiers who look to be over the age of forty crane their necks to get a glimpse of Saul. Those who are lucky enough to stand next to him are paying little attention to Surina’s instructions, instead choosing to crack jokes for Saul’s benefit. He blesses a few of them with a chuckle in response. 

“Sheesh, Surina wasn’t kidding,” says Beifir to Valmus. “It’s like Saul is the cool kid and they’re all trying to impress him.”

“Oh, just wait until they’ve had a few drinks,” says Valmus. 

“Whoa, your voice is back!” says Beifir.

“Huh, guess so,” says Valmus. He clears his throat. “Still a little scratchy.”

Saul’s entourage now regales him with all the latest news from Aberith.

“Do you think he’s really not into the attention?” says Beifir.

“Nah, that’s complete bullshit,” says Valmus. “As an accomplished bullshitter myself, I can tell you for sure: he loves this.”

When everyone has passed through the portal, Gunnloda holds up her glowing hand. On the other side, Halbert Jonin raises a hand too. They high-five. In an instant, the portal disappears into the evening air as the sunset reaches its fiery peak. The town square is alive with a buzzing energy. Now that they are truly cut off from the outside world, it feels like a party has begun.

“Sil-ver Chain! Sil-ver Chain!” someone chants, prompting laughter and scattered repetitions. 

“Engineers, to me!” calls Gunnloda as she removes the gauntlet of teleportation. “No time to waste. The orc invasion is imminent, and we have our work cut out for us.” 

At this, someone cheers, as if the approaching bloodthirsty horde is excellent news. More laughter. Gunnloda scowls, but she holds off on lecturing them due to the entrance of a tall, silver-cloaked figure. 

“Well met, soldiers of the Silver Chain Company!” cries Bynrize, to more raucous cheering. “I am Bynrize, the mayor of Eillin, and I wanted to personally thank you for your aid during this critical time for our town.” 

He pauses and stares out over the town square as if chewing on a profound thought. 

“Many of you will probably perish in the act of protecting this very small, perhaps insignificant outpost of civilization…” He pauses again. “Yes, the orc raiders will certainly succeed in killing some of you. Savagely. But you’re here anyway.” He sighs. “And I just want you to know that that’s really beautiful to me.” 

A few soldiers respond with confused applause, which peters out quickly. 

“Anyway, where was I? Ah, yes. I appreciate you all! Many, many thanks!”

In the ensuing buzz of confused murmuring, he turns toward Surina, smiling warmly.

“Might I have a word with the officers before things get, ah, really going?” he asks.

“Of course,” says Surina. She beckons the other four to gather round.

“I had one more thing I forgot to tell you all,” says Bynrize, once Saul manages to extricate himself from his gaggle of fans and join them. “There’s an individual who lives just outside town limits. Ma Thunderstruck, they call her. Only dwarf resident in the area—she and her son, that is. She’s a bit of a hermit, but she comes to town to trade every so often.”

Gunnloda raises her eyebrows, then furrows them. So this is the southern dwarf whose explosion caught her by surprise.

“And you’d like us to bring her into town for her protection?” asks Surina. 

“Oh, I’m not so much worried for her safety,” chuckles Bynrize. “She takes care of herself just fine out there. But she’s a builder of interesting contraptions that could aid in our defense, if she were willing to lend a hand.”

“Do you anticipate any difficulty on that front?” asks Valmus.

“She’s a good-natured lady,” muses Bynrize. “I don’t think she’d necessarily be opposed to it, but she does like her solitude.” He nods at Gunnloda. “I do think Ms. Snowmantle might have a lot in common with her, and perhaps could form a connection.”

Gunnloda grunts. 

“We’ll see.”

“I would like to oversee our initial setup here in town,” says Surina. “Gunnloda, would you please lead this effort to seek out Ma Thunderstruck? I may join you later, but I can’t leave the troops unsupervised at the outset.”

“Yes, ma’am,” says Gunnloda.

Bynrize indicates the location of Ma Thunderstruck’s compound on the map of Eillin.

“It’s a few hours’ walk to Ma’s place,” he says. “Perhaps each of you can take care of any imminent tasks tonight, rest a bit, and then make the journey to meet her at dawn.”

“Excellent idea,” says Surina. 

Gunnloda finds the engineering squad leader, Michele Gotthold. He is a tall and skinny human man whose face is obscured by a dark, curly beard that connects to an equally voluminous mane of hair.

“Michele,” she says. “You’re in charge tomorrow. I’m leaving you my tools.” She dumps her various toolkits at his feet. “Start with reinforcing the gate, then the most rotten areas of the wall.”

“Where will you be?” he asks. “We’ve only just arrived.”

“Classified,” says Gunnloda. She stalks off toward Beifir, who is giving the scouting squad leader instructions of his own. 

“Any questions, Gitte?” Beifir asks. Gitte Florenzia, his second-in-command over the scouts, is an unusually short and slight human woman with green eyes and an olive complexion.

“Yes, actually,” says Gitte. “Mostly about the part where we’re supposed to spy on a teenager?”

“The mayor’s daughter, Cazna,” explains Beifir. “And not all of you, just some of you. The rest of you will be on the perimeter looking out for orcs.”

“Yes, but… why?” asks Gitte.

“She’s dabbling in some potentially dangerous forces and—I just need you to!” says Beifir, blushing. “We don’t have time to get into it. Just keep track of the girl.”

“Whatever you say, boss,” says Gitte.

Gunnloda and Beifir then join up with Valmus and Saul, who have gone to the town’s social hub, a tavern called the Gourd.

“What are you doing?” asks Gunnloda, upon spotting them at the bar with full mugs of pumpkin ale. “This is not the time to be fraternizing with civilians. We need to be putting our affairs in order and then getting some rest. We’ll want to set out before sunrise if we want to make good time—”

“Slow down, short stack,” says Valmus. “This is all part of it.” He nods his head toward a crowd of Silver Chain soldiers, a grizzled-looking set, ordering drinks next to them at the bar. “We’ve set some of Saul’s fan club to the task of gathering intel.”

“What kind of intel?” says Beifir.

“I want to know if there’s anyone in town who can talk to me about alchemy,” says Valmus. “Or protective hexes. And Saul…”

“Just keeping an ear to the ground regarding some of the internal tensions we’ve been hearing about,” murmurs Saul. “The Builders, the Weavers… the drow, and their relationship to the half-elves…”

“I suppose some of that may be relevant,” grumbles Gunnloda. “Don’t get carried away. I’ll be waking you two hours before dawn.”

Gunnloda’s word is good. She rouses her roommate at the inn, Surina, in the dead of night, a look of stubborn intensity on her round face.

“I’ll catch up with you later,” says Surina, rolling over in her too-cramped bed. “And I promise, not just because it’s too early for me to process a coherent thought.”

“Your call, ma’am,” says Gunnloda. “You know my preference is never to split the company—”

“I’ll have no trouble tracking you,” says Surina. “I just want to see the troops off to a productive start this morning. Promise.”

“Fine,” says Gunnloda. She stomps loudly into the room shared by Beifir and Valmus. Surina can hear the yelps of protest as Gunnloda drags them each out of bed by the collars of their pajamas.

Leaving Surina in Eillin, the other four officers make an uneventful trek out of town on the path Bynrize indicated. They catch sight of a large, squat building that can only be Ma Thunderstruck’s compound just as the sun reddens the hills beyond. Indeed, when the morning light pierces the sky over the horizon, forcing them all to squint, they see a dwarf woman chopping firewood ahead of them. She sings to herself. The scent of cedar burning from the chimney greets them before they can make out any of the song’s words.

“I know this song,” says Gunnloda. “It’s a Mountain Dwarf song.”

As they get closer, the words become clearer. True to her task, Ma Thunderstruck is singing about chopping timber in a wintry dawn.

“Those aren’t the words!” gasps Gunnloda. “It’s about the beauty of fresh snowfall at sunrise, not—not—some kind of *chore*.”

Valmus takes a bite out of an apple he has skewered on the edge of his dagger. 

“Maybe you should sing the right words, so she can learn the truth,” he says, smirking through a mouthful of fruit. 

“You’re right,” says Gunnloda. She takes a deep breath and lets loose in a confident contralto. "*Mountain sky, mountain sky, anoint us…*" 

Ma Thunderstruck stands up, alert, at the sound of another voice echoing her song. She smiles and continues singing: "*Forest high, forest high, generous…*"

It’s a lovely little moment between two dwarves, until Ma Thunderstruck realizes Gunnloda’s words are different from hers. At that point, she starts singing louder, and chopping with correspondingly more forceful swings of her axe. Gunnloda, in turn, raises her own voice until she is essentially screaming a verse about the ephemerality of footprints in crisp morning frost.

Ma Thunderstruck applauds this last with notable graciousness.

“Well! Hi there! What can I do for y’all?” she asks, hands on her hips. Her axe rests atop the pile of firewood she has produced; she appears neither defensive nor threatening.

“Hello,” says Gunnloda, clearing her throat. “What an interesting version of a traditional Northern Mountain Dwarf folk song you were singing.”

“Mountain dwarf song!” exclaims Ma. “I don’t think so. My daddy taught me that song.”

“Did he?” says Gunnloda. “And what is your father’s name?”

“Daddy went by Crunk,” says Ma. “Crunk Thunderstruck. Quite a fella. R.I.P. Missed by all who knew him.”

“I see. Well, it’s nice to meet you,” says Gunnloda. “I am Gunnloda Snowmantle, of the Snowmantle clan, of course. I’m sure you’ve heard of us.” She pauses, but Ma doesn’t give a sign of recognition. “These folks behind me are my crew. We’re here to seek your aid in the protection of the nearby town of Eillin.”

“Eillin, sure!” says Ma. “How’s old Byn doing?”

“He seems fine,” says Gunnloda, “but we have some concerns, namely, that there’s an army of orcs approaching the town, and its fortifications are in dire need of upgrades. We brought in our troops—we represent the free company of the Order of the Silver Chain, based out of Aberith, I’m sure you’ve heard of us, too—but we could really use any resources you might have, as a person who has lived in this area for a long while.”

“Of course, of course,” says Ma. “Byn’ll be fine, I’m sure. Those orcs are all pushovers!” 

She gestures behind her to a crater in the ground where an explosion evidently took place. Multiple charred orc bodies are scattered within and around it.

“Wow,” says Gunnloda, unable to hide her envy. “How did you do that?”

“Oh, I can show you later!” says Ma. “Listen, I have an idea, if you’re up for it.” She trundles over to Gunnloda and gives the other dwarf’s bicep an aggressive squeeze. “Yeah, you seem strong.”

“I’m *very* strong,” says Gunnloda, taken aback.

“I’ll do you a deal. I’m happy to help defend the town, but I’m right in the middle of an operation, you might say,” says Ma. “There’s one last bit of work I need to do at an excavation site before the orcs get here. If you’d help me with that, I’ll come with you.”

“Where might this site be?” asks Saul, stepping forward from behind Gunnloda. “Would it happen to be a cave beside a well-traveled road?”

Ma laughs, her face brightening with recognition.

“Ah, ran into that, did you?” she waits for responding laughter, but receives none. “Sorry about that. I was going to clean it up, but I got distracted.” She points again at the crater of dead orcs behind her. “Everybody okay?”

Gunnloda’s eyes are narrow enough to almost be fully closed.

“Yes,” she says, after a long silence.

“That was delta site,” Ma explains, “and I’ve already checked out beta site, but I really believe alpha site is where we’ll find the artifact.”

“Artifact?” says Valmus.

“Here, why don’t y’all come inside?” says Ma, waving them toward the front door of the compound. “I’ll tell you all about it.”

They follow her over an elevated path that traverses a trench surrounding the compound. She leads them inside to a cozy kitchen and dining area, where a small boy sits in a high chair. His face lights up as they all enter, and he bangs a wooden cup against the table to greet them.

“Say hello, now, Frunk,” says Ma tenderly. “We got some guests today.”

Frunk babbles happily, but fails to form an intelligible word.

Ma unrolls a charred and brittle map on the kitchen table. 

“Daddy didn’t leave me much, but he did leave this,” she says. “If my calculations are correct, I believe here’s where we’ll find the artifact.”

She points toward an area of the map that has been circled multiple times. The map has a lot of Dwarvish writing in multiple colors of ink all over it, and it’s rather difficult to follow.

“And what is this artifact?” asks Saul.

“I’ll be honest with you, I don’t quite know what to expect,” says Ma. “But my daddy treasured this map, so it’s gotta be worth something. I figure we go on down to alpha site, see what all is there, pull it on out, and then I’ll come with y’all back to Eillin to help with the orcs.”

“Is this going to involve another explosion?” asks Beifir. “We almost didn’t escape the last one.”

“Well, sure, we gotta blast the entrance to get in,” says Ma, as if this is obvious.

Gunnloda nods repeatedly, sort of overselling the idea that she understands what Ma is talking about.

“Might I ask what your first name is, Ms. Thunderstruck?” she asks.

“Oh,” says Ma. “They call me ‘Ma,’ but it ain’t ‘cause I’m a mama, though I am. It’s short for Marjoram.”

“But that doesn’t rhyme with Frunk or Crunk,” says Gunnloda, surprised.

“I don’t know how it works in the north,” says Ma, “but the whole name-rhyming thing isn’t required.”

“Oh, up north, it definitely is. Everyone in a family has a rhyming name,” explains Gunnloda. “So I’m the daughter of Smunnloda, who is my mom, and Trunnloda, who is my dad. And it’s a funny thing, because only people who already have rhyming names are allowed to reproduce!”

“Oh,” says Ma. “That—explains a lot,” she finishes, uncertainly.

Beifir is heaving deep, hysterical breaths, leaning on Valmus for dear life.

“That explains *everything*,” he wheezes.

“Well, we’re all learning a lot today,” says Ma diplomatically.

“How long would you say the journey to alpha site will take?” asks Saul.

“Maybe a day,” says Ma.

“Let’s get going, then!” says Valmus. He finishes his apple and incinerates the core with a snap of his fingers. 

---

After Ma puts Frunk down for a nap, she leads the officers out the back of the compound into the woods.

“Will he be okay in there, all alone?” asks Valmus.

“Who?” says Ma.

“Frunk,” says Valmus. “Your son.”

“Ha!” says Ma. “Yes, the little guy’s just fine on his own. Safe as can be. Whole trench outside is wired to explode on contact, matter of fact.”

“Oh,” says Gunnloda, eyes wide. “Yes, wired to explode.”

Valmus is unsatisfied.

“But what if *he* touches the trench? By accident?” he asks.

Ma laughs uproariously, but doesn’t have an answer.

“Ma?” says Saul. “What’s that thing? Under the tarp?” He points to a massive, canvas-covered shape leaning against the outer wall of the compound.

“Oh, just a little something I’ve been working on,” she says. “I’m sure Byn’s told you.”

“He hasn’t gone into much detail, actually,” says Saul, but Ma seems too focused on the mission at hand to explain.

She moves ahead into the woods, and the group follows along. Saul, however, casts Major Image, and a replica of himself continues along the path while he lingers back at the compound.

He lifts the corner of the tarp, but what he sees doesn’t make much sense to him. It looks like a metal tube mounted on a wheeled wooden frame. The tube is pointed down, and part of it is hinged. There’s a complicated mechanism on its top—he sees pressure gauges, tubes, wheels, and gears, but has no inkling of how they all work together or what they might do. 

He shrugs and jogs ahead to catch up with the illusion of himself, which he then dismisses.

“How old is your baby boy, then?” Beifir is asking as Saul rejoins the group, undetected.

“He’s about to turn ten,” says Ma.

“Ten and still in a high chair, huh?” Gunnloda remarks.

“Well, he ain’t the brightest boy, but he’s a sweetie,” says Ma proudly.

“And, uh... is there a Pa Thunderstruck?” asks Beifir. 

Saul groans and elbows Beifir in the gut. 

“Again?” he hisses.

Ma’s cheeks turn red, and she starts to cough, successfully diverting the conversation toward the need for a handkerchief, which Valmus proffers without comment.

They reach alpha site by late afternoon. Saul immediately recognizes a mechanical device similar to the one he saw beneath the tarp. This one is positioned atop a stone slab that has been unearthed a few feet beneath the site’s surface.

“There she is!” cries Ma. “I call it the door-knocker, ‘cause it’s gonna knock this door to pieces. Now, stand back, and stay alert. This is the easy part. Afterward, I’ll be glad for your help.”

She jogs over to the device and climbs to the box on top. From a satchel at her belt, she produces some black powder and pours it into the receptacle. She twiddles some dials and locks something into place, and then pulls out a cartoonishly large match, striking it against the side of the device.

“I’d cover your ears if I were y’all,” she warns. She lights a fuse and scampers down to hide behind a boulder, ears covered.

Gunnloda frowns. Her better angels tell her to follow the other dwarf’s instructions and take appropriate safety measures, but her wounded pride tells her she doesn’t need to take precautions dictated by a southern fool.

In a few seconds, Gunnloda hears the loudest sound she’s ever heard, and immediately regrets her decision. When the dust clears, Ma trundles over to survey the damage.

“Y’all can come on out now,” she announces. Gunnloda only hears a loud ringing, but she follows the lead of her fellow officers.

“So, is this what you were expecting?” asks Beifir. 

Ma digs through the rubble until she unearths a shattered hatch door above a deep vertical tunnel.

“Hot diggity damn, I reckon it is!” says Ma. She glances at Gunnloda, who looks shell-shocked. “You all right there, sister?” 

“WHAT?” says Gunnloda.

Ma tosses a rope ladder down the hole.

“Never mind,” she guffaws. “All right, let’s go! Who’s first?”

“Do you know what’s down there?” asks Beifir.

“The treasure, my boy!” says Ma.

“Cool, cool, cool,” says Valmus. “I’m gonna not go first, if that’s okay with everyone.”

“Fine with me,” says Ma. “Anyone feeling lucky?”

Gunnloda waves a hand, deferring to Ma.

“Sure, I’ll head in first then,” says Ma. She clambers down the rope ladder. Gunnloda, not wanting to appear soft, follows next. 

They climb down at least two hundred feet until they reach a hexagonal chamber. Strangely, the temperature rises as they descend. At the bottom, it’s downright steamy. 

“Too hot down here,” says Gunnloda. “Not a dwarvish construction, I imagine.”

“Yes, seems unusual,” says Ma. 

The other three officers come down. Saul says a prayer, but doesn’t get a good sense of a divine presence in the room. There’s a tunnel leading off of one wall. 

“So now we just have to find the artifact, right, Ma?” asks Valmus.

“Certainly seems like some type of treasure’s gotta be down here,” says Ma. “Why go through the trouble of building a place like this if not to hide your treasure?”

“So you didn’t see anything like this at beta or delta site,” says Beifir.

“Nope,” says Ma. “Just rocks.”

She leads the way down the tunnel. Every so often, she takes out a piece of parchment and a stick of charcoal and makes a rubbing of the carvings that line the tunnel walls. It’s difficult to tell what they represent—there’s writing in an angular script, but none of them recognize it. 

After several hundred feet, the tunnel gets wider. Out of the shadows, a massive shape appears. It has the fangs and gaping eye sockets of what can only be a dragon skull. 

“Look at that thing!” gasps Ma. 

“Nature boy,” says Saul, addressing Beifir. “Any idea what type of dragon that was?”

“I’m no expert on dragons,” says Beifir. “But let me see.” He climbs up the side of the skull until he’s standing on the upper edge of one of its massive jawbones. “You know, this sort of contextual information leads me to believe the writing on the walls is Draconic. It does look a lot like the texts I’ve seen Surina reading from time to time.”

“Dang,” says Valmus. “Wish she were here to translate.”

“This is why we don’t split up the party,” mutters Gunnloda.

“Whoa, wait a second,” says Beifir. “There’s something inside here. In the dragon’s ribcage, I mean. It looks like a giant gemstone.”

“The treasure!” says Ma. “I knew it!”

She swings her grappling hook up toward the skeleton’s spine and begins climbing up the ribcage. 

“Sweet sassafras!” she cries, letting out a whistle. “It’s a big honker of a jewel, too. Somebody’s suspended it in the breathin’ bones by a bunch of ropes, but I reckon I can cut it loose given enough time.”

She produces a serrated knife from a holster at her belt and begins sawing away at one of the ropes. As soon as she does so, three iron doorways swing open in the walls. Eighteen small, scaly humanoids with crocodilian snouts appear, surrounding them.

“Dag nabbit! Kobolds!” says Ma. “Can y’all fight them off while I get this thing? Sorry for the inconvenience.”
