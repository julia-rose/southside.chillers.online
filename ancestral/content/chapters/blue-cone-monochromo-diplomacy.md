“And you’re *sure* you didn’t know this was going to happen, right, Ma?” says Valmus over the rising din of squawking kobolds. 

“Well, treasure’s often got somebody or other guarding it, so it don’t get stole,” says Ma, with a shrug. “Never quite know what to expect!”

“Excellent, excellent,” says Valmus, his eyes aglow with irritation. “Especially good that we don’t have our dragonborn sergeant here to help against these critters, which are known for their *worship of dragons.*"

“You’re not scared of these things, are you?” scoffs Gunnloda. She draws her sword with a satisfying metallic sound and smiles at it fondly. “Breathtaker will make quick work of them.”

“Yeah, I almost feel bad,” says Beifir. A miniature flaming arrow from the first group of six kobolds hits him squarely on the butt. “Ow! All right, no I don’t.”

He shoots a dart back at the offending kobolds and manages to slice through two adjacent necks with one hit.

“Yes, no use pitying these pests,” says Saul. “They have none for you.” 

In a grim illustration of his attitude, he summons a wall of unholy flame that splits the chamber in twain. Several kobolds shrivel in the fire. 

“What’s with those guys?” says Valmus, pointing at the third group of kobolds, who each sport cheerfully-colored, monogrammed backpacks. “You know what, I’m not going to wait and find out.” He casts Slow on the backpack kobolds, and their motion becomes comically… slow. It’s like they’re running through invisible jelly.

Gunnloda slices two kobolds in half with her sword. More kobolds attack her, wielding scorpions on the ends of sticks. They whack her with the odd contraptions, but only one of them gets a solid sting to her hand.

“What even—!” she starts to exclaim.

But her attention is diverted by another wave of kobolds appearing in each iron doorway. Some of them have wings; some of them carry shields and spears; one of them, ominously, holds a tacky-looking magic wand.

“We need reinforcements,” says Beifir. He summons a flock of eight giant owls from thin air and directs them toward the winged kobolds, tearing a few apart with their talons. 

Meanwhile, Ma Thunderstruck is still cutting the ropes binding the gem to the interior of the dragon ribcage.

“Good work, y’all!” she calls to them. “These goons’ll be toast in a jiffy!”

“Yeah, sure, anytime,” says Valmus as a group of six kobolds surrounds him. Each one lands a quick hit with its blade, leaving Valmus bloodied and without the glint of his usual jovial humor in his eyes. He summons a Fireball in his right hand and lobs it at his attackers, wiping them out in one. 

On one side of Saul’s wall of flame, the kobolds regroup to attack him, seeking to break his concentration. They form a protective barrier around their only mage, who waves his cheap-looking wand and casts Scorching Ray on Saul. 

“Oh, I don’t think so,” Valmus growls. He casts Counterspell, which behaves like an invisible glass jar around the jets of fire that erupt from the mage’s wand, containing them. Saul’s lips flicker into a smile, and he nods in thanks. His hands are still raised in the air, sustaining the fiery wall, which lends a demonic cast to the light on everyone’s faces. 

On the opposite side of the wall, Gunnloda has become the primary target. The kobolds with the scorpion-sticks shift gears and toss vials of acid at her feet. Despite her heavy-duty footwear, one of the vials eats through and burns her toe. Another kobold with a shortsword slashes her in the back. Then the kobolds with the shields and spears manage to puncture her armor, leaving their spears stuck in her chest. 

None of this is enough to truly damage Gunnloda, but it does succeed in whipping her into an enraged frenzy. Gritting her teeth, she swings her greatsword, Breathtaker, through the closest group and cuts them all in half, generating a horrific pile of limbs and torsos still moving independently of one another in the throes of death. The kobolds step back as she swings again, felling several more, blood spattering the chamber floor like rain. 

“Dare you to try again,” she taunts the survivors.

The winged kobolds—the ones who have not been torn apart by giant owls, anyway—fly up to where Beifir stands on the dragon skull and attack him with their darts. He loses his concentration, and the fleet of owls disappears. The winged kobolds then descend on Saul and break his concentration, extinguishing the wall of fire. Saul doesn’t seem too perturbed, though. He swings his enchanted axe and kills three at once. A darkness falls over him. Is it just the absence of the fire, or is it something more? 

No one has time to really figure it out, because the sound of roaring and the smell of smoke approaches from the corridor, and then Surina appears in the archway. She says something in Draconic that makes the kobolds freeze in place, then retreat, whispering in apparent excitement. They disappear back into the three wall hatches. The battle is over.

“What are you guys *doing*?” she says. “You were meant to go find Ma Thunderstruck, not squander your strength fighting kobolds in an underground bunker! I had to track you from town all the way here just to find you wasting time on some off-mission foolishness. I expect better from all of you.”

“It’s not off-mission, ma’am, I promise,” says Gunnloda, sheathing her sword. “Ma Thunderstruck asked for our assistance here as a condition for helping us. It’ll be worth it. She’s very... capable.” 

From the dragon ribcage, Ma Thunderstruck hollers a hello.

“Almost done, I reckon!” she adds. The massive jewel is cut free in another few seconds, and Ma whoops with excitement. She lashes it to her back and begins climbing down.

“So, you’re Ma Thunderstruck,” says Surina. “Good to meet you. I’m Surina, Sergeant and Captain of the officers of the Silver Chain Company.”

Ma reaches the ground and trundles over to shake Surina’s hand.

“Pleasure to meet you, too,” she says. “Your crew did a heck of a job down here. Nice work, everyone.”

“Yes, they’re all highly skilled,” says Surina. “I understand you’re willing to help us, then, with the incoming orc invasion?”

“Deal’s a deal!” says Ma. “Shall we head on back to town?”

“Wait!” says Beifir, still clambering down from the dragon skull. “Before we go, Surina, there’s a lot of Draconic on these walls. Can you translate them?” 

“I suppose so,” says Surina. 

They all gather behind her while she inspects the carved mosaic that takes up much of one wall. 

“Well, the imagery alone is fascinating,” she says, sounding surprised. “It’s a game of dragon chess, but far more complicated than the version Gunnloda and I play. And the game pieces… these are symbols for various gods, are they not? Oh, yes, there’s Pelor.” She points to a piece—perhaps a bishop—with the sun-face symbol at its head.

“And Lolth, and Yeenoghu, and Maglubiyet, and Eilistraee,” Saul names the gods whose symbols he recognizes: a spider, a flail, a goblin face, a full moon. “And Shargaas.” The crescent moon and skull, same as the one carried by the orcs who nearly killed him.

“Look at the background,” says Valmus, pointing at a five-headed dragon shape. “Isn’t that the god of dragons? That one’s not a game piece, it’s… it’s the one playing the game.”

“Tiamat,” says Surina, nodding. “Queen of the chromatic dragons.”

“So what does the inscription say?” prods Beifir.

“Oh,” says Surina. She squints at it and rubs her temples. “There’s something interfering with this text. The letters get all swirly when I try to read them—it’s kind of giving me a headache.”

“But,” says Gunnloda, “can you do it, though?”

Surina frowns. 

“I don’t know what’s going to happen to me if I do,” she says.

“C’mon!” says Beifir. He tries starting a chant, but only Valmus joins in. “Read it! Read it!”

“Fine,” she sighs. “All right, the first line says… ‘The great working draws complete.’” She stops. “Ow, you guys, this really hurts. I don’t think I should read more. I’m feeling kind of woozy.”

“You can’t stop now!” says Valmus. “We need to know what ‘the great working’ is!”

“When I entered the chamber and told off all those kobolds, they whispered something about a ‘speaker,’” she says. “What if my reading this makes me the speaker? What if it awakens something?” She looks around for any support. “Really, you all think this is important enough to risk that?”

“Yes, probably,” says Gunnloda.

Saul gives Surina an apologetic shrug. With an exaggerated sigh, she reads the second line.

“‘The pretenders crack and fall,’” she reads. Then she sways, all seven feet of her, and stumbles. “Pelor! I think I’m gonna faint… assholes, all of you…!”

She falls forward onto the chamber floor, unconscious. 

---

The Company makes the grueling climb up two hundred feet of rope ladder and out of the underground hideaway while lifting Surina out on a makeshift stretcher. Valmus flops down to lie on the ground as soon as he emerges.

“Never again,” he groans. “How is she so heavy?”

“All those scales, I bet!” Ma Thunderstruck offers cheerfully. “Well, I’m gonna get going. I gotta head back to my place and check on little Frunk, but I can meet you back in Eillin later. Y’all go ahead and hitch the door-knocker up to that horse and take it with you, now.”

“Fine, I guess,” says Gunnloda. Once Ma is out of earshot, she murmurs to the other officers, “I do hope this was worth it.”

“Surina will be fine,” says Saul. “She’s stable, and we’ll just have to wait for whatever this enchantment is to wear off. We have the exploding machine now, and the orcs will have nothing like it.”

“And Ma gave us her charcoal rubbing of the wall inscription, so Surina can read the rest of it when she wakes up,” says Beifir.

“Don’t know if she’ll like that idea,” says Valmus. 

Out of the nearby woods, a small blue cone can be seen bobbing above the tall grass.

“The cone!” gasps Beifir. “The blue cone! It’s back!”

Approaching closer, a little man appears beneath the cone. It’s a gnome wearing a hat. Beifir grabs Saul’s sleeve.

“I told you! I told you there was really a blue cone!”

“This is what you saw?” says Saul. “A little guy with a hat on? That’s not how you described it before.”

“I only saw the hat!” Beifir says. He sniffs the air. “And the cinnamon! Smell it now, smart guy?”

Saul rolls his eyes.

The gnome, they see as he waddles toward them, is carrying a small frying pan filled with deliciously fragrant mushrooms. No one quite knows what to say as he takes a forkful of mushrooms and waves it beneath Surina’s nose. She opens her eyes.

“Mmm,” she says. “What’s that smell?” She sees the gnome. “Oh, hello! Did you just revive me?”

The gnome nods and gives a little bow.

“Thank you, kind sir!” says Surina. 

“You are quite welcome,” says the gnome. His voice sounds like he has recently inhaled helium.

“How did you know these mushrooms would help me?” she asks.

“Oh, I’ve been living in these woods a long time,” says the gnome. “I know all about the mushrooms. Never knew there was an underground bunker here, though! Strange.” 

A small black dog with long, floppy ears emerges from the tall grass behind him and runs a few laps around his ankles. 

“Where’d you get your hat?” says Beifir. “It’s a great hat.”

The gnome pops off the blue conical headpiece and inspects it, as if seeing it for the first time.

“You know, they’re standard issue for gnomes,” he says. “Who knows where they come from?”

“See? When he takes it off, it’s just a blue cone,” Beifir nudges Saul. To the gnome, he explains. “We saw one of those hats up a tree a ways back on our journey through the woods.”

“Oh, yes, that was me,” says the gnome.

“Were you following us?” asks Valmus.

“I pay attention.”

“What’s your name?” asks Gunnloda. The gnome perks up.

“My name is Humphrey, and this is my dog, Puck,” he says. He gives Puck a pat on the head.

“And why were you following us?” asks Saul.

“I saw five heavily-armed people enter the place where I live,” says Humphrey, shrugging. “I thought I’d just keep an eye out to make sure that you weren’t a threat.”

“Well, thank you so much, once again, for your help, Humphrey,” says Surina.

“My pleasure!” he says. “Come on, Puck.” He turns to go, but Beifir interrupts.

“Wait! The town nearby is about to be attacked by orcs,” he says. “Do you know about this? Are you worried for your safety? We can help you.”

“Towns come, towns go,” says Humphrey. “I live in the forest. I am not worried. But I wish you the best of luck.” He gives Puck a scratch behind his ears. “Byn’s not a bad man. Once in awhile, he and I trade mushrooms.”

“What kind of mushrooms?” asks Beifir.

“All mushrooms, my boy,” says Humphrey. “I know them all.”

“What about these?” Beifir pulls out the truffles he found the other day.

“Ahaaa!” says Humphrey. “You have a rare treasure indeed! Would you be willing to trade, young sir?”

“For more mushrooms?” asks Beifir.

“Yes. I have one that would be very good for you,” says Humphrey. He puts down his frying pan on a log and takes a glowing blue button mushroom out of one of his many pockets. 

“What does it do?”

“Let me ask you this, dear boy. What are you looking for in a mushroom?”

“Uhhhh,” says Beifir. “Hold on just a minute. Let me talk with my friends first before I make any trades.”

“Certainly,” says Humphrey.

Beifir turns back toward Surina, who is now sitting up and looking healthier than before.

“I hate to ask you this, but could you finish reading the Draconic inscription while this guy is still here? Just in case he needs to revive you again,” he says.

“Ugh,” says Surina. “Yes, I suppose that makes sense. All right.” Beifir hands her the charcoal rubbing of the text. “The complete poem says… ‘The great working draws complete; the pretenders crack and fall; the queen on her throne shall reign; when we hear the herald’s call.’” She thinks for a moment. “Oh! Herald was the word I heard them use before. Not speaker. Herald.”

“Does this mean anything to you?” asks Valmus.

“Actually, yes,” says Surina, “I know this poem. I haven’t heard it since… since I was really little.” Her voice dries up, and her next words are strained. “I don’t know how I know this.”

“And you didn’t faint this time,” says Gunnloda. “That’s good news, right?”

Surina says nothing. Valmus and Saul exchange awkward looks.

“I’m going to trade my truffles for this glowing blue mushroom,” Beifir announces, and he turns back toward Humphrey.

“We have a deal, then?” asks the gnome.

“Yes,” says Beifir. “And, hey—if we need to contact you in the future, maybe for more mushroom trades, how can we get in touch?”

Humphrey uses a funny little fake hand on a stick to reach up and pat Beifir on the shoulder.

“Never mind that,” he says, chuckling. “All right, Puck, let’s go.” 

The little dog barks excitedly and follows Humphrey back into the forest.

---

After hitching Epic the war horse up to the exploding door-knocker machine, the Company makes its way back to Eillin. They encounter Gunnloda’s direct reports working on reinforcing the gate when they arrive. The engineers, led by frizzy-bearded Michele, have made an acceptable amount of progress by Gunnloda’s standards. 

“Yes, this is adequate,” says Gunnloda, pacing back and forth beside it. “Good work.” 

She notices a young soldier wandering nearby, looking unsteady.

“Who’s that? And why isn’t he working on something?” 

“That’s Geoffrey Torpleton,” says Michele. “Rookie recruit. Looks like he’s been hitting the sauce.”

Sure enough, Torpleton leans against the wall and retches.

“Ah,” says Saul. “My guys may be to blame. I put them on duty at the Gourd to gather intel from the locals.”

“Yeah, he’s been tagging along with some of the more seasoned troops,” Michele admits. 

Gitte, Beifir’s second-in-command of scouting, jogs lightly over to them when she sees they’ve arrived.

“Welcome back,” she says. “Patrols have been quiet. It seems like the orcs are approaching at the same steady pace, still a day or two away. We’ve managed to get some residents of the remote outer hamlets into town for safety.”


“And… Cazna?” asks Beifir.

“We tried our damnedest to keep an eye on that girl,” says Gitte. “But she’s hard to track.”

“Gave you the slip, huh?”

“I wouldn’t want to believe it of our best scouts, but I went with them a couple times and witnessed it myself,” says Gitte. “She can do this thing where she splits in half, and you can’t tell which version of her is the real one, and then she loses you.”

“Safe to say she knew she was being watched, then,” Beifir says.

“Seems that way,” says Gitte.

“Well, thanks anyway,” says Beifir.

“Shall we follow up with our agents at the Gourd?” Valmus asks Saul.

“Yes, and I wouldn’t say no to a pumpkin ale, either,” says Saul. 

Beifir, Gunnloda, and Surina look on, expecting their invitation.

“I guess you all can come, too,” says Valmus. “If you want.”

“Sure!” says Beifir.

They arrive at the Gourd as its patrons begin a rousing rendition of an old drow drinking song, with lyrics all about the dubious charms of the Underdark. The Silver Chain soldiers are participating with enthusiasm.

“Hate to interrupt,” says Saul to a salt-and-pepper-bearded soldier drinking squash vodka out of his own helmet. “But I was wondering if you could tell me what you’ve been able to learn about the conflicts amongst the factions in town.”

The soldier does a spit-take upon seeing Saul. He looks thrilled to have been chosen. 

“Saul Kegan!” he slurs. “*The* Saul Kegan! You’ll never believe it, man. We’ve got this whole town figured out.”

“Keep your voice down, if you could,” says Saul. The song continues, but Saul’s eyes dart around the room suspiciously.

“And did you find out about anyone who practices alchemy or sorcery in town?” Valmus butts in. His cachet among the soldiers is not nearly as pronounced as Saul’s, so he must ride coattails where he can.

“Yeah,” says the soldier. “Everybody was like, ‘Just go talk to Baromar!’ and we were like, ‘Who?’ and they were like, ‘The guy who lives in the sickest house in town,’ and we were like ‘Ohhhhh.’”

“Helviund House, then?” says Valmus. “Not Bynrize’s observatory? Which is also pretty sick.”

“Duh!” says the soldier. “His name’s Baromar Helviund!”

“Anyway,” says Saul, “you said you have the town figured out. That’s great. Can you tell me—”

But the soldier has been urged by his peers to chug the rest of the squash vodka from his helmet, and he is lost to the officers.

“To Helviund House, then?” Saul sighs. 

As they leave, they see young Geoffrey Torpleton re-enter the bar to a flurry of cheers.

“TORPLE-TON! TORPLE-TON!” chant the drunks.

The boy grins goofily at the room full of newfound friends. A surprisingly burly half-elf claps him on the back.

“Boot and rally, son, that’s how you do it!” 

“I’ve seen enough,” says Surina. “Let’s go.”

They make the short walk over to the multi-tiered and dramatically black Helviund House, which sits removed from its street by many meters more than any other residential structure they’ve seen. Valmus steps up to the front door and gives it three firm knocks.

“Yes?” says a young drow man, opening the door just a crack. He wears a pin on his lapel of a silvery-white orb, perhaps a full moon.

“Hi,” says Valmus. “Can I speak with Baromar Helviund?”

“Mr. Helviund has gone to rest,” says the young man. 

“Wait, like he’s…?” Valmus starts.

“He should be back in town soon, but he’s not here right now,” clarifies the young man.

“Oh, okay,” says Valmus. “What’s your name?”

“I am Altontrin Vorilar,” says the young man. “And you are?”

“Valmus,” says Valmus.

“All right, then, well, it’s nice to meet you, Valmus, but I’m afraid I can’t help you,” says Altrontrin. He moves to shut the door.

Valmus puts his foot between the door and the jamb, glancing at Saul behind him, who nods.

“Wait,” says Valmus. He casts a silent spell, Suggestion, on Altontrin. “Take us to Baromar.”

“Oh,” says Altontrin, his pupils expanding. He opens the door and steps out. “Yes, I suppose we can go find him.”

“So he’s not just inside?” asks Valmus, craning his neck to see the house’s interior.

“Oh, no,” says Altontrin. “As I said, he has gone to rest, and will return to Eillin soon.”

“What’s that pin you’re wearing?” asks Saul, as Altontrin leads them out from Helviund House back onto the street. “I’ve seen a few of those around town.”

“I belong to the Moon Gazers,” says Altontrin. “I am an assistant at the Temple of Eilistraee. I’m sure you’ve seen it. Large red glass moon sigil on the tallest steeple in town.”

Altontrin leads them not toward the Gourd, and not toward the temple, but toward the path leading out of town entirely.

“How do you know Baromar?” asks Valmus.

“Mr. Helviund is one of the most prominent and generous citizens of Eillin,” says Altontrin. “He has donated a great deal of money and materials to the temple. I help around his estate sometimes.”

“So is he a Moon Gazer, too?” asks Valmus.

“Mr. Helviund belongs to the Weavers, and thus wears their symbol, a spinning wheel,” says Altontrin. “They are a historical society here in town.”

“What kind of history?” asks Saul.

“They believe that the drow, like trees, have deep roots, and as much as we want to embrace life on the surface, we can’t live without our Underdark roots. So we must maintain connections between the old world and the new.”

“I see,” says Valmus, cocking his head to the side and scanning the other officers’ faces for their reactions. “Is there anything you can tell us about where you’re taking us?”

“Mr. Helviund departed almost two days ago,” says Altontrin, “toward the west-northwest. Into the woods.”

“And what do you know of the happenings in town?” asks Saul. “Anything unusual going on?”

“Mayor Bynrize has visited the Temple of Eilistraee frequently of late,” says Altontrin. “He seems to be planning something with the high priest, though I know not what.” He pauses, thinking. “The tower builders have ceased activity. The site has gone quiet.”

“What tower?” asks Saul, but Altontrin does not respond.

They walk for hours out of town and into the darkening forests to its northwest. Beifir resists the urge to walk ahead of their guide, and Surina shoots warning looks at Valmus and Saul while muttering her disapproval to Gunnloda.

“Are we almost there?” asks Valmus, after nearly six hours. 

“No,” says Altontrin. “But we are on our way.”

Valmus and Saul share a look. 

“Lead the way,” says Saul.

They pass through a particularly gorgeous section of the forest that is crowned by a freshwater lake, its surface glittering underneath the light of the rising moon. Valmus feels a shiver down his spine, and imagines building a cabin under the shade of the red-stemmed dogwoods and black willows that line its shore. He could grow old here, he thinks. Maybe settle down with someone and start a family. He shakes the thought out of his mind—where is this coming from? Aberith is his home. It’s a pretty forest, that’s all.

As they pass the lake, the Suggestion spell reaches its eighth and final hour. Altontrin turns around and stares at them in confusion.


“What are we doing?” he asks. “I’m sorry. I think I made a mistake. I—I’ve got to go back to Eillin.” 

He walks backward before beginning to jog back the way they came.

“Nonsense! We’re almost there!” Beifir calls after him.

“It’s getting dark,” says Altontrin. “We shouldn’t be here.”

“Why not?” asks Saul.

“The orcs are coming!” Altontrin hollers before disappearing.

He’s not wrong, but the officers mill around for several minutes in disappointment. 

“How close do you think we are?” asks Surina. “I hate to think we’ve wasted all this time.”

“We’ve got to be close,” says Valmus, skipping a stone across the surface of the lake. “I have a feeling about this place.”

“I’ll cast Locate Creature,” says Beifir. He does, but there is no sign of Baromar Helviund within a thousand feet.

“Time to head back,” says Gunnloda, whose face is stony and impassive. “If we are late for the invasion, I will murder you myself, Valmus.”
