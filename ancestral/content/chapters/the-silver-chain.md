*Modern historians designate the period between about 350 and 600 as “The Wandering Age.” During this time period, Aberith was not yet the dominant power on Ivrend, but a growing city-state with clear ambitions.*

*Outside Aberith’s immediate vicinity, the scattered settlements of Ivrend were always at risk, and vulnerable to opportunistic waves of hobgoblin and orc armies, as well as the predations of common bandits.*

*In this unsettled time, Aberith was making its first uncertain gestures toward more permanent security responsibility, but was internally divided and lacked formal military institutions. Into this void stepped a number of “free companies”—informal military groups of various ideologies and motivations, employed by the Crown of Aberith against emerging threats. One of the most famous of these campaigns was the second Battle of Eillin, in which the Silver Chain Company faced off against the legendary orcish general Zahgorim.*

*The Silver Chain Company was a peculiar offshoot of the Order of the Silver Chain, a paladin order headquartered in Aberith. The order itself was eventually critical to the establishment of Aberith as the dominant power of Ivrend. But during the Wandering Age, it was largely a figurehead organization, wrapped up in court politics, public charity, and real estate development.*

*One entrepreneurial senior paladin of the order, Sir Halbert Jonin, founded the Silver Chain Company to capitalize on the recruitment potential of the Silver Chain brand, and began offering security services to influential nobles. Over the ensuing years, the company steadily eclipsed the order in the public eye, and acquired a reputation for ambition and mercenary tactics.*

Walking out of Aberith is like traveling into the past. As the fledgling city fades from view behind you, the markers of civilization recede into the earth until everything around you—land, sky, forest, river—feels new as a morning dewdrop.

Villages become farms become thicket-dotted meadows. The darkness of night, when it falls, is complete. The rustling of beasts and the whispering of trees remind you that your solitude is an illusion. In the dim and damp pre-dawn, if you fail to move decisively, the ground threatens to swallow and digest the path beneath you.

Four officers of the Silver Chain Company travel thus out of Aberith. A fifth officer trails a day’s journey behind them. They seek a village known as Eillin, or Eilien, or Eileen, depending on the map. Its mayor isn’t picky about the spelling. His only request is that they arrive in time to protect the village from a band of orcs that is methodically sacking villages, one by one, throughout southern Ivrend. 

The officers make the trek through on foot first without their soldiers, intending to make use of a set of enchanted gauntlets to teleport the troops in after them. Why waste the resources, or the lives, of marching across miles of uncleared land? The five of them can be trusted to deliver—that is, if they arrive before the raiders do.

The scout, a young elf druid named Beifir, leads them, passing so fluidly between the trees that he might be mistaken for one. He’s often mistaken for things he is not—most recently, a snow-tipped hawk and an immature stag. That’s all by design. He finds that becoming part of the forest is the best way to know the forest. The forest, then, leads the way. He’s on his *hyppää-ympäriinsä*, sort of like a break between his childhood and his adulthood, and instead of spending it partying on the lavender sands of Kukallinen like his best friends, he’s navigating a company of mercenaries across the continent. Radical transformation suits him.

Second, and more conspicuous by far, struts Valmus, the attaché. Unlike Beifir, he’s someone who could never be seen for anything other than what he is: a sorcerer, a tiefling, and a smooth talker with a forked tongue. His horns curl around his ears like a ram’s and his eyes are never not red. If he had his way, their journey through the uninhabited wilds would be much quicker, not to mention more comfortable, because he’d have persuaded the young rancheress from the last farmstead into loaning him her five swiftest horses, a crate of her family’s illicit speed-enhancing horse feed, and her spacious covered wagon. 

But he’d had to defer to the judgment of the stout little figure in full battle armor who walks behind him. Her name is Gunnloda Snowmantle, and she’s a Northern mountain dwarf and the company’s tactician. Her mood? Fine. Her hand axe? Sharp. Her greatsword? Sharper. (She makes a mental note to sharpen the hand axe.) She surveys the path before her and imagines adversaries approaching from her northwest. Given a group of fewer than six brigands, hobgoblin or similar, she’s confident she could cut them to the ground without needing backup. More than six? Or from the northeast? She’ll have to think about it.

Of the first four, Saul, high cleric of Pelor, brings up the rear. He’s not the oldest in years, but—as he has had to gently remind the others more than once—nearly six decades will slow down a human. He wears a set of plain traveling robes under his cloak, fastened by a silver brooch resembling a many-pointed sun. It’s a far cry from his usual getup, but the back country is not kind to embroidered silks and ceremonial armor. Lavish vestments and commemmorative helms from admirers and well-heeled names in Aberith come in weekly ever since his famous intercession prayer on behalf of the army against the hobgoblin menace up north. “There is only Pelor to thank,” he’d remind them, but of course, he still accepted the gifts.

Thirty miles behind him, and on her own, is Surina, their charismatic de facto leader. (Due to a scheduling conflict, she was unable to depart from Aberith on the same day as her fellow officers, and has been traveling at a breakneck pace to catch up with them.) Traveling alone in the largely lawless expanse of rural Ivrend is not widely recommended. But Surina, an orphan from youth, is used to fending for herself; and, incidentally, she is a dragonborn. She finds that her appearance has a curious effect on humans. There was a moment on the second day of her solo journey when she spied a group of thieves waiting to ambush travelers along the road. But when she passed, they made no move to confront her.

The four officers traveling together stop walking after a signal from Beifir. 

“Two figures ahead,” he whispers. “One taller than the other. They don’t appear to be armed.”

Gunnloda keeps her hand on her axe.

“We proceed with caution regardless,” she reminds them. In Surina’s absence, the battlemaster has been calling the shots. She doesn’t need to say that these are the first humanoids to cross their path in days, and that they’re miles deep into territory vulnerable to raids.

But as the figures come into focus ahead, even she stands down. They appear to be a drow woman and her young child, laden with household belongings and studiously avoiding looking anywhere but at the ground.

“Well met,” calls Valmus, when they are within earshot. “How are the woods today?”

The woman takes in his appearance. Her long, pointed ears flatten like a cat’s, and she moves to shield her son from view.

“We’ve already paid,” she says. “Please, just let us be on our way.”

Valmus holds up his hands and flashes her his most charming smile.

“Oh, no, nothing like that, ma’am,” he says. “We’re just passing through, ourselves. Paid who?”

“The soldiers, sir,” says the woman.

“Soldiers?” Valmus takes a step toward her, and she takes one back. “Of what faction?” 

“I didn’t ask.” Her eyes dart back and forth as if looking for the exit to the conversation. 

From the back of the group, Saul steps forward. He indicates the symbol of Pelor on his brooch and waves off Valmus’s attempts at friendliness.

“Nothing to be afraid of,” he says. “We mean you no harm. We’re just curious if there might be bandits ahead, or others who are bothering travelers on the road.”

The woman seems reassured. Whether it’s his age, his gentle demeanor, or the holy symbol he wears that does the trick is unclear.

“So you’re not with the other soldiers?” she asks.

“No affiliation whatsoever,” says Saul.

“Oh, good,” she says. “Well, there’s a group of some… hooligans… back there. They set up a blockade at the turn in the road toward Eillin. Asking for payment from refugees, and roughing up the ones who can’t give them anything.”

“Might I ask where you are a refugee from?” says Saul.

“We lived on a farm outside Eillin,” she says cagily. “But things got bad. And it’s time to go.”

“And can you describe what these ruffians looked like?” says Saul.

“Humans, sir—begging your pardon.” She gives him a nervous smile. “Dressed like soldiers.”

“Do you have any plans to return home?” pipes up Beifir.

“Maybe someday,” she says. “If things get better. But it’s been a bad few weeks.”

Valmus kneels to the ground and beckons the drow boy to come closer. Despite his mother’s resistance and his obvious terror, he does so. Valmus does a nice bit of sleight-of-hand and pulls a piece of candy from behind the boy’s ear. He squeals, delighted, and his mother even cracks a smile. 

“Thanks very much, sir,” she says. She picks up the child, who clutches the candy and stares at Valmus in awe. “We’d best be on our way.” 

The officers continue on through denser forest and softer ground. The path is not very well defined here, but they have the woman’s footprints, at least, to guide them in the right direction. After less than an hour, Beifir raises a hand to signal another stop.

“Roadblock up ahead,” he says. “I’ll approach and see what I see.”

“I’ll join you,” says Saul. He casts a quick spell and transforms before their eyes into a drow woman with a striking resemblance to the one they just met. “I’d like to see what they’re doing before we arrive as a group.”

“We’ll back you up from a distance,” says Gunnloda. 

Saul and Beifir now look like a pair of elves taking a leisurely walk through the forest, as elves are wont to do. The men at the blockade lower a pike over the path as soon as they notice the two of them coming around the bend. 

“Sure you’re headed the right way?” one of them hollers, his arms crossed. “Most travelers are going in the other direction.”

“We’re meeting an old friend,” says Saul, keeping his voice soft and calm. He sounds suitably androgynous. “Not looking for any trouble.”

“Standard fare is twenty gold,” says another guard, who wears an eye patch.

“If I may ask,” says Beifir, “on behalf of whom do you collect this toll?”

“Just a routine security checkpoint, sir,” says the eye patch man.

“But this road belongs to everyone, unless I am much mistaken,” says Beifir. “What is your authority here?”

The two men mutter something to one another, then call behind them to the one who must be their leader.

“Looks like we’re having some resistance here, sir,” says one. “Going to need toll evasion enforcement.”

A few more men—hooligans truly is the right word—appear from beside a hut in the trees nearby.

“We paid earlier, on our way south,” says Saul, changing tacks. “We were told we’d have free range of the road.”

“Permits are unidirectional, ma’am,” says a hulking gentleman wearing his hair in an elegant man-bun. “I’m afraid you purchased a ‘going south’ permit. Now you’ll need a ‘going north’ permit.”

Although Valmus and Gunnloda can’t hear the particulars of the conversation from their hidden vantage point, they sense that conflict is imminent. Indeed, in the next moment, they hear the telltale ursine roar of Beifir transforming into a bear. They hustle to catch up.

When they arrive on the scene, Beifir—in the form of a shaggy-pelted grizzly—has pushed two of the bandits to the ground and holds them there. Saul has abandoned his disguise. He now summons his mage armor and double-headed axe from the ether in a blaze of light that stuns one guard into dropping his pike. 

Valmus can’t suppress a grin, his eyes glowing like embers. With an odd flick of the fingers on his left hand, a visible field of heat distorts the air in his palm. He tosses the heat in the direction of the hut—it explodes, expelling three charred bodies into the surrounding forest. 

The remaining bandits panic. One of them flees north on the path. Another makes a wild swing at Saul with his pike. Two more of the brigands fire arrows at Valmus from the branches of trees, scrambling to get down before the fire from the hut spreads.

The bandit leader with the man-bun is taken by surprise when Gunnloda cuts him in the back of the knees with her greatsword. 

“Save yourselves!” he calls to his remaining soldiers. The archers from the trees make a run for it, but Saul shoots a blast of energy at one of them. He stumbles to the ground on his face, twitching. Beifir rips another man’s throat out with his teeth. 

The leader, who is limping away from Gunnloda, does not get far before she loads an arrow into her heavy crossbow and pins him to the ground with it. 

“Wait,” says Valmus as she prepares to load another, “let me question him first.”

He jogs over. But before he can get a word in, the leader pulls a sharp implement from his man-bun and slits his own throat.

“Ugh,” says Valmus, wrinkling his nose at the prodigious spray of blood. He brushes some off of his sleeve. “Fine, then.”

A burning branch crashes to the ground across the path like a curtain falling at the end of a play. The four of them stand amid a mess of smoldering timber and corpses.

“Good work, everyone,” says Gunnloda, tucking the arrow back into her quiver. She walks over to the dead bandit leader and retrieves the first one as well. “Let’s salvage what we can from these bodies.”

She and Valmus rifle through the pockets of the leader’s waistcoat. They find a small, sky-colored badge with a symbol neither of them recognizes. 

“No free company I’ve ever heard of,” she murmurs. 

“Small timers, I guess,” says Valmus.

Saul finds a singed lockbox in the ruins of the hut. It pops open easily, having landed badly in the explosion. 

“A hundred gold in here,” he reports. He empties it into his satchel.

Meanwhile, Beifir circles the area, still in bear form. He sniffs the ground—these woods are sour with neglect, he thinks. Not like home. He inhales the air. Something odd, something like cinnamon, or cloves… coming from the west, he thinks. He looks up. Just above the treeline, he sees a blue cone, floating—the source of the scent? Just as he stands on his hind legs to get a better look, it vanishes. He returns to elf form and joins the others, looking puzzled.

“Three-foot blue cone smells like cinnamon,” he says. His speech, at times, is garbled or simplistic when he first returns to himself.

“Come again?” says Saul.

“Blue cinnamon cone! Three feet tall, floating above the trees. Smelled like cinnamon, then disappeared,” Beifir repeats. “Anyone else see that?”

“No,” says Gunnloda. “All right, let’s keep moving.”

“Wait, can I just climb a tree to see if it’s hiding in there?” says Beifir. 

“Fine, but make it quick, elf boy,” says Gunnloda. She squints at the sunlight through the trees. “Afternoon’s getting thin.”

Beifir scales a tree with the casual acrobatics of a squirrel.

Valmus chuckles at Saul, who is whispering a spell under his breath. He points to the skyline, where he has conjured a three-foot blue cone.

“I see it!” says Beifir. “It’s quite luminous—definitely magical in origin—and it’s almost calling to me…”

Saul and Valmus continue snickering as Saul directs the cone to begin rotating. 

“I’m not getting the cinnamon smell anymore, though—hey!” Beifir calls, as the sound of laughter below becomes too loud not to notice. “Saul!”

“Sorry,” says a grinning Saul, dismissing the illusion.

Beifir climbs down.

“I did see some muddy prints on the tree trunk that are not mine,” he says. “Someone magical was up in that tree, I think, and didn’t come down by physical means. They may still be there.”

“Thank you for the intelligence,” says Gunnloda, who has found none of this entertaining. “If we’re being watched, we have no time for games.” She procures her map of Ivrend and shakes it flat. “I propose we continue at thirty miles per day until we reach Eillin.”

“Thirty?” says Beifir. “I won’t be able to scout properly at that pace. I’ll miss things. We already almost missed the blue cone and the prints on the tree. I’d say let’s do…” He does some mental math. “Twenty-four at most.”

“I am willing to compromise,” says Gunnloda. “We can travel at twenty-eight miles per day. That’s my final offer.”

“But—”

“We have a mission we were entrusted to fulfill,” says Gunnloda. “If we arrive too late to protect the citizens of Eillin from the raiders, we cannot call ourselves an effective company.”

“Listen, big shot,” says Beifir, towering over Gunnloda by at least two feet. “Just because you think you’re invincible doesn’t mean you know the range of threats that a forest contains. And we can’t protect anyone if we die on the road.”

“We’re not going to die, elf boy,” she says. “Onward.”

Grumbling, Beifir speedwalks ahead. 

The afternoon deepens, and at their new pace, they all grow sweaty and irritable. When they reach a narrow passage through a tall, rocky cliff, even Gunnloda takes the opportunity to slow down.

“Huh, there’s a sign,” says Valmus, pointing toward an opening in the rock face. “Can’t read it, though.”

“Oh,” says Gunnloda, with mild interest. “It’s Dwarvish.” She squints at it. “Some southern dialect, though. The second word means something like ‘digging,’ but not quite. The first word is ‘danger.’”

“So it says ‘danger digging?’” says Saul.

“More like, “Danger! Digging in progress,’” says Gunnloda. “And it looks like there’s a clan name inscribed there, too.”

“What’s the name?”

“Never heard of them myself,” she muses, “but ‘Thunderstruck.’”
