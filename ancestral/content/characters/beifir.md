# Backstory

Beifir Järvinen is from an isolated druid-led wood elf village, Laakso, deep in the forests in western Ivrend. Laasko has a tradition known as hyppää-ympäriinsä, in which adolescent elves are encouraged to spend a few decades in the outside world, taking risks and seeking thrills, before returning to forest life.
In his second decade of hyppää-ympäriinsä, Beifir decided to join the company on a whim. Fearless and impetuous, his tracking and stealth skills (not to mention his propensity to shape-shift into woodland creatures) quickly earned him the position of senior scout.
