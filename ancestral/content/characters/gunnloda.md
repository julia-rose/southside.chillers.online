# Backstory

The Snowmantle clan is embedded firmly in the majestic northern mountains of Ivrend. It's a difficult place, with roaming monsters, hard winters, and ancient magic. By tradition, every tenth daughter of the clan is tasked with journeying south to "the warm lands" to master the latest arts of war-craft and fortification from the faster-moving lowland cultures.

Gunnloda was most recently entrusted with this misson. Raised from birth steeped in her ancestors' martial traditions, she's a formidable combatant with an encyclopedic knowledge of logistics and tactics. Since joining the Silver Chain, she's given special attention to recent technological advances in seige warfare and defense.

Driven by a strong sense of duty to her people, Gunnloda is not particularly invested in the ethos of the human-dominated paladin order that runs the Silver Chain Company. However, having accepted the role of senior engineer, she takes her commitment seriously; her sense of responsiblity reflects the traditional words of the Snowmantle clan: "Do it because you have to."
