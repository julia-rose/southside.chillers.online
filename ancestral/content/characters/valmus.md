# Backstory

A native of the growing city of Aberith, Valmus is an experienced mediator, and serves as the company's Attach√©. It's cheaper (and better publicity) to negotiate terms of honorable surrender for defeated foes rather than fight them to the last man, and equally valuable to have a skilled negotiator when it comes time to collect payment.

Valmus joined the company in the hopes of gaining security and prestige through the somewhat-meritocratic world of the battlefield. A tiefling's position in Ivrend is always precarious, but even the most opportunistic ruffians will think twice before harrassing a member of the Chain.
