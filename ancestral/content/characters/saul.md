# Backstory

A cleric of Pelor, Saul has long served as chaplain for the company. After an uneventful young career at Aberith's primary temple, Saul grew restless and decided to take the light of his ministry to the field, where young men and women wrestled with true moral challenges.

He gained the lasting trust of the enlisted troops during a harsh campaign in the northern mountains, trying to put down a hobgoblin uprising. The goblins were tenacious, striking military and civilian settlements with devastating raids. Saul refuses to acknowledge it directly, but the soldiers credit his prayers to Pelor for a divine intervention that struck down the hobgoblin general during a decisive battle.
