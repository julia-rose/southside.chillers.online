# Backstory

An orphaned dragonborn, Surina was rescued as an infant from an obscure catastrophe in northern Ivrend. She was adopted by the paladins of the Order of the Silver Chain, and strongly identifies with its protective ethos. A natural and charismatic leader of soldiers, Surina inspires strong loyalty from the rank and file of the company.

As a clanless dragonborn, Surina lacks the traditional clan first name, and has always hungered to understand what happened to her people.
